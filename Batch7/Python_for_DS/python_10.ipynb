        "- **Terminal apps let you play with complex code, without layers of abstraction between you and the user.**\n",
        "    - When you write more complex graphical applications, there are layers of abstraction between you and the user. To get input in a terminal, you issue the command `input(\"Please tell me some information: \")`. When you want some information in a graphical program, you have to build text boxes and buttons for submitting information. That has gotten pretty simple these days, but it is still more complicated than what you will do when writing terminal applications. Terminal applications let you focus on getting the logic right, rather than building a graphical interface.\n",
        "- **You will learn about user interaction issues.**\n",
        "    - Terminal apps do have users, even if that is just you, and maybe your friends or family. If you see people using your applications at an early stage, you will write better code. There is nothing like watching people use your programs to make you code more defensively. You know to enter a string in some places, but what keeps your users from entering numbers? Influencing your users to give you the right information the first time, and being prepared to deal with the wrong kind of data are good skills as a programmer. Having real users at an early stage in your programming career is a good thing."
