The rules for naming a class are the same rules you learned about [naming variables](var_string_num.html#naming_rules), but there is a strong convention among Python programmers that classes should be named using CamelCase. If you are unfamiliar with CamelCase, it is a convention where each letter that starts a word is capitalized, with no underscores in the name. The name of the class is followed by a set of parentheses. These parentheses will be empty for now, but later they may contain a class upon which the new class is based.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is good practice to write a comment at the beginning of your class, describing the class. There is a [more formal syntax](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for documenting your classes, but you can wait a little bit to get that formal. For now, just write a comment at the beginning of your class summarizing what you intend the class to do. Writing more formal documentation for your classes will be easy later if you start by writing simple comments now.\n",

        "Function names that start and end with two underscores are special built-in functions that Python uses in certain ways. The \\_\\_init()\\_\\_ method is one of these special functions. It is called automatically when you create an object from your class. The \\_\\_init()\\_\\_ method lets you make sure that all relevant attributes are set to their proper values when an object is created from the class, before the object is used. In this case, The \\_\\_init\\_\\_() method initializes the x and y values of the Rocket to 0.\n",

        "The **self** keyword often takes people a little while to understand. The word \"self\" refers to the current object that you are working with.

Basically, all methods in a class need the *self* object as their first argument, so they can access any attribute that is part of the class.\n",

If you had to create a new class for every kind of object you wanted to model, you would hardly have any reusable code. In Python and any other language that supports OOP, one class can **inherit** from another class. This means you can base a new class on an existing class; the new class *inherits* all of the attributes and behavior of the class it is based on. A new class can override any undesirable attributes or behavior of the class it inherits from, and it can add any new attributes or behavior that are appropriate. The original class is called the **parent** class, and the new class is a **child** of the parent class. The parent class is also called a **superclass**, and the child class is also called a **subclass**.\n",
