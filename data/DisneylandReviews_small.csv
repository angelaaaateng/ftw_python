670772142,4,2019-4,Australia,If you've ever been to Disneyland anywhere you'll find Disneyland Hong Kong very similar in the layout when you walk into main street! It has a very familiar feel. One of the rides  its a Small World  is absolutely fabulous and worth doing. The day we visited was fairly hot and relatively busy but the queues moved fairly well. ,Disneyland_HongKong
670682799,4,2019-5,Philippines,"Its been a while since d last time we visit HK Disneyland .. Yet, this time we only stay in Tomorrowland .. AKA Marvel land!Now they have Iron Man Experience n d Newly open Ant Man n d Wasp!!Ironman .. Great feature n so Exciting, especially d whole scenery of HK (HK central area to Kowloon)!Antman ..

This 1 is Great!!!For cast members (staffs) .. Felt bit MINUS point from before!!! Just dun feel like its a Disney brand!!

But, just really Dont feel it!!Bakery in Main Street now have more attractive delicacies n Disney theme sweets .. These are Good Points!!Last, they also have Starbucks now inside the theme park!!",Disneyland_HongKong
670623270,4,2019-4,United Arab Emirates,"Thanks God it wasn   t too hot or too humid when I was visiting the park   otherwise it would be a big issue (there is not a lot of shade).I have arrived around 10:30am and left at 6pm. Unfortunately I didn   t last until evening parade, but 8.5 hours was too much for me.There is plenty to do and everyone will find something interesting for themselves to enjoy.It wasn   t extremely busy and the longest time I had to queue for certain attractions was 45 minutes (which is really not that bad).Although I had an amazing time, I felt a bit underwhelmed with choice of rides and attractions. The park itself is quite small (I was really expecting something grand   even the main castle which was closed by the way was quite small).The food options are good, few coffee shops (including Starbucks) and plenty of gift shops. There was no issue with toilets as they are everywhere.All together it was a great day out and I really enjoyed it.",Disneyland_HongKong
670607911,4,2019-4,Australia,"HK Disneyland is a great compact park. Unfortunately there is quite a bit of maintenance work going on at present so a number of areas are closed off (including the famous castle) If you go midweek, it is not too crowded and certainly no where near as bus as LA Disneyland. We did notice on this visit that prices for food, drinks etc have really gone through the roof so be prepared to pay top dollar for snacks (and avoid the souvenir shops if you can) Regardless, kids will love it.",Disneyland_HongKong
670607296,4,2019-4,United Kingdom,"the location is not in the city, took around 1 hour from Kowlon, my kids like disneyland so much, everything is fine.   but its really crowded and hot in Hong Kong",Disneyland_HongKong
670591897,3,2019-4,Singapore,"Have been to Disney World, Disneyland Anaheim and Tokyo Disneyland but I feel that Disneyland Hong Kong is really too small to be called a Disneyland. It has way too few rides and attractions. Souvenirs, food and even entrance tickets are slightly more expensive than other Disneyland as well. Basically, this park is good only for small children and people who has never been to Disney. The food choices were acceptable, mostly fast food, and not too expensive. Bottled water, however, was VERY expensive but they do have water fountains around for you to refill your water bottles. The parade was pretty good. It was crowded not a problem but what was the problem was the people were just so rude, the pushing and shoving cutting in lines for the rides, gift shops, food stands was just to much to take. forget trying to see one of the shows its a free for all for seats, i don't see how Disney can let this happen, it was by far the worst managed Disney property.",Disneyland_HongKong
670585330,5,2019-4,India,Great place! Your day will go by and you won't even know it. Obviously went there for my daughter and she absolutely loved it! Too bad the parade got canceled though.,Disneyland_HongKong
670574142,3,2019-3,Malaysia,"Think of it as an intro to Disney magic for the little ones. Almost all of the attractions can be completed in 1.5days.One drawback was the timing. For example, Disney's Storybook Theatre is closed Wed Thu for private events. Some restaurants close mid week Tue Thur as well. So best not to plan your visit during mid week.The biggest disappointment is the food at the Park. Even Maxim's is so so only. The only decent Restaurant is Main Street Corner Cafe and the Main Street Bakery. And do be prepared for the typical abrupt HongKong style service from the serving staff.",Disneyland_HongKong
670571027,2,2019-4,Australia,"Feel so let down with this place,the Disneyland train was fantastic until you get past the station,bad signage, terrible staff who just did not want to be there ,it was rainning and rides were not working could not find a map of place, over priced fun park. Disney characters only 2 seen under a cabana having photos with visitors queuing up in the rain. Dont waste your money. Walt Disney would be horrified, not enough eating places for the amount of people or rest rooms. Seems they are building something but who knows what. No atmosphere of fun and fantasy. ",Disneyland_HongKong
670570869,5,2019-3,India,"I can go on talking about Disneyland. Whatever I say about it, is less. Disneyland is all about your childhood dreams come true. Starting from the Entrance, the environment, popcorn, the shows, everything. Even the MTR Trains and the station is specially designed. In my opinion one should by a Two Day Ticket to explore it well if you have time. Else few of the attractions may remain incomplete in one day. An online Two Day Ticket can save around HKD 100 in comparison to an on spot ticket.  Must NOT Miss  attractions include the Jungle River Cruise, Micky's Phillhar Magic (a 4D Show), The Lion King ShowIt is better to have some home work regarding the Show Timings so that you can maximise the number of shows you can cover. It is better to avoid Sundays or the public holidays to avoid rush.",Disneyland_HongKong
670443403,5,2019-4,United States,Disneyland never cease to amaze me! I've been to Disneyland florida and I thought I have exhausted the kid in me but nope! I still had so much fun in disneyland hong kong. 2 DL off my bucketlist and more to come!     ,Disneyland_HongKong
670435886,5,2019-4,Canada,"We spent the day here with our grown kids and I have to admit we had a great time. It seems the kids never tire of Disney. There aren   t as many rides as the states Disney parks but they have some great ones no less. Do the haunted house, catch the lion king show, space mountain, and the iron man experience to list a few. They have lots of shops that you have to spend some money in of course. The kids will love the day!",Disneyland_HongKong
670376905,4,2019-4,Australia,"We spend two days, the second day went early then went straight to the back of the park, no lineups for so children got to go on many rides, some twice in a row. This Disneyland is very suitable for young children ours were 7,6,5,4,3 and 1 so most of them could go on all the rides, it was disappointing the castle was closed no nightly fireworks. Would not like to go in the hot season.",Disneyland_HongKong
670324965,5,2019-4,Philippines,It was indeed the happiest place on earth! My family had really fun and it made my daughter's birthday a memorable one!,Disneyland_HongKong
670274554,5,2018-9,Australia,"This place is HUGE! Definately need more than one day. We had 3 children aged 11, 9 & 6 and they loved it. A great variety of rides and attractions for all ages. Food options were fantastic with 3D models of what you were ordering. Staff were fantastic, very helpful. An awesome family experience. ",Disneyland_HongKong
670205135,3,2019-1,United Kingdom,"We brought tickets before we left and got 2 days for less than the price of 1. After visiting would advise everyone to look for an online deal not worth the walk up price. Castle was closed due to that area being refurbished and altered, weekday aprox no more than a 30 min wait for rides with most being less than that would not recommend weekends or holidays. As has been said like all Disney parks and theme parks in general food and drink is expensive .This is a small park and can easily be done in 1 day",Disneyland_HongKong
670199487,4,2019-4,Myanmar (Burma),"Its huge , not enough to visit in one day. We did with 2 days pass ... all the scenes were amazing ... you were like in movies, fairytales, etc. At 8 pm, we have enjoyed lots with the character show on the street. Must Visit !!! ",Disneyland_HongKong
670129921,3,2019-4,United Kingdom,Around   60 per person and if you want to eat or drink at any point it was cost you a small fortune. If you go on a week day like we did I assume like us you will wait around half an hour per ride. At the time we went the Disney castle was under construction.. it doesn't look like it will be finished soon. Fast track is free for everyone but single rider was a lot faster. An average day at an expensive place. ,Disneyland_HongKong
670099231,4,2019-4,Australia,It   s Disneyland! It just does not need reviewing!  Place speaks for itself.  However smaller than I expected.  Great experience,Disneyland_HongKong
670033848,5,2018-11,Hong Kong,There is nothing more to say except that you become a child once again as you step inside Disneyland in HK!  Easy to go and come out with dedicated trams and subway stations.  Wait for the parade at sunset it is definitely worth waiting!,Disneyland_HongKong
670030877,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,"We bought a 2 day tourist ticket via Klook which made it better value. It was good to have a day to get our bearings and a second day to go on the rides we missed and to go back on our favourite ones again. It also means less queuing.The shows and parades were amazing. We saw the Lion King, Moana and Mickey   s Wondrous Book. Unfortunately there is some works on so the Castle isn   t visible and the train is not open. We still had a magical time.  ",Disneyland_HongKong
670022335,3,2019-4,United States,"First off I'm not a really big Disneyland fan. I live about 20 minutes from the California Disneyland, and haven't been in over 10 years (by choice). We were on vacation in Hong Kong and were able to get free tickets, so why not. First getting there by subway from downtown was super easy. I will say I was impressed with how the train that takes you there was decked out in all the Disney themes. Next the park was okay just super small compared to the one here in California. The castle was under construction so that kinda of sucks and the train didn't run. We went on a Wednesday so it was slow. There are not a lot of rides, so please don't come with that idea. It's a nice place for little kids, but thrill seekers stay at home. One tip make sure you read the description of each ride before you wait in line, because I will never get those 30 minutes of my life back (Iron man experience).",Disneyland_HongKong
670007081,3,2019-4,United States,Mickey and the Wounderous book was great and the kids love it. The new Ant man attraction was good for all ages. Our four year old love the pubs afraid waiting in line because of the loud noises. The 10 year old was afraid of Iron Man   s ride it   s good for 12 and I   ll probably but it was a great ride. The castle is under major construction so there   s no fireworks. Overall the park is still beautiful and wonderful to visit and buy the teacup ride there is a good restaurant that has Standard Chinese food at reasonable prices for Disney. You   ll Have a great day or two. Still probably the best attraction in Hong Kong for children one of the top two for sure. Adults can go on roller coasters and other rides as well they will not be disappointed. ,Disneyland_HongKong
669996858,3,2019-4,Singapore,"I   ve been to Hong Kong Disneyland twice and even with new attractions such as the Ant Man and the Wasp, the experience was really flat and not as enjoyable as other Disneylands in the region. With Sleeping Beauty Castle under renovation, pictures taken at the main square isn   t that appealing with the scaffolding in sight. Souvenirs, food and even entrance tickets are slightly more expensive than other Disneylands. ",Disneyland_HongKong
669783708,5,2019-4,Australia,"GO early if you want to do photos with the signboards and Mickey Donald Duck. Otherwise, you could spend an hour just waiting in line to get a free photo. The paid photo is also available at a price.Tomorrow land Iron Man was excellent and we did it twice.Philar Magic is really awesome.Fantasy Land is great for the rides.Adventure Land has some nice opportunities to take photos with Tarzan, a treetop house visit, a boat cruise for kids.Grizzly Gulch was one of my favourites, Roller Coaster ride was worth the 15 minute wait.",Disneyland_HongKong
669548161,3,2019-4,Hong Kong,Disneylands the world over are generic apart from the language. This was no different than the others. It was a shame about all the building work and some closed eating areas.  Definitely worth a visit if you have young children.,Disneyland_HongKong
669528186,3,2019-4,Australia,"This was my second trip here, the first been about 3 years ago. This is a smallish Disneyland park. The attractions are of a high standard but there are few thrill rides and no outdoor roller coaster. The park was clean and tidy. Food was expensive in the park not of an excellent qualify (ie served like warm or cold) and there were few vegetarian options.The castle was under renovation at the time of my visit. The park is easy to walk around and many of the attractions are great for kids. Lines were virtually non existent with our longest wait 20 minutesOverall worth a visit if you are with the kids in Hong Kong and have the time. The park entry is also comparatively inexpensive when compared to other Disneyland parks.",Disneyland_HongKong
669403596,5,2018-12,Philippines,We have been to Hong Kong Disneyland a few times already but we still want to come back. Why? Because there are rides we were too chicken to try the first visits that we finally had the courage to try and we ended up loving them. We love the Big Grizzly Mountain ride. We thought it will be too scary but we love it now. Will be back again!,Disneyland_HongKong
669353396,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,We visited here on a Wednesday. We arrived for opening and found the queue times to be short and had done most the rides we wanted to by early afternoon. Unfortunately there were no fireworks due to the castle being renovated and we have seen many parades at Disney world so we decided not to stay for the evening. ,Disneyland_HongKong
669186152,3,2019-4,Australia,"I need to say I have been to    home of Disney    Disneyland Anaheim. HK Disney is about an 8th of that park!    Biggest ride    (as in scary) was Space Mountain. Mostly kiddy rides other than that. We did really enjoy the Lion King show. I can   t get over how expensive it was. Water equates to $6 AUD a small bottle and a burger combo meal equated $22 AUD!!!! We also stayed at Disney Hollywood Hotel   where they have u by the balls and charge insane prices ($120 AUD) for buffet dinner or $55 AUD for breakfast. There are no shops   cafes   supermarkets nearby to grab a snack or cheap dinner, unless u take 2 trains! After travelling thru HK  China for 3 weeks it was just crazy expensive for crappy deep fried food or a flavourless bowl of lettuce salad. Very few food places open. Castle under maintenance. Train under maintenance. vouchers we got on the way in stating ALL shops on main st have 10% discount before 1030... then told at bakery    that not here   ?!!! At home that   s called false advertising?!! Toy Story land was insanely hot   no shade, sun bouncing off light concrete   my husband actually had a hypo while waiting for daughter on ride coz it   s so hot. Come on Disneyland... surely you can put up some    camo style shades    so waiting parents don   t pass out?! A few seats for elderly wouldn   t go astray either. All up pretty disappointing experience and about $900 AUD poorer, for 2 adults & 1 child for 2 day pass (note: u won   t need to go back for a second day). ",Disneyland_HongKong
669093045,5,2019-4,Australia,"Took a five year old and a two year old. Could not fault anything other than a hire pram being pinched, which was quickly replaced.  Staff amazing. If you can stay at one of the hotels, do so.  Makes it all much easier.",Disneyland_HongKong
669050447,4,2019-4,Australia,"A great day out even for adults.We can early and we're able to do almost all rides in a couple of hours. The restaurants were great and a good selection of different foods. Try the caramel popcorn! Unfortunately, when we went the bars and 1 restaurant was closed, but still other options available.The rides are mostly for little kids bit a couple were good for adults. The shopping was the highlight of the day with huge selection of Disney gifts and clothing. Note if there is a daily special get it early as it will sell out. There is not a lot of shade so bring hats and an umbrella.",Disneyland_HongKong
668819140,5,2019-4,Australia,"I went to Hong Kong Disneyland with a little trepidation as our family had been to Disneyland in California 6 months previously.No trepidation needed, we all loved HKDL! Loved loved loved it.Yes, its much smaller than California and there are not as many fast paced rides, none the less, we had a great day. The park is beautiful and the experience is just like being at Anaheim.We went on a day where large amounts of rain were expected, so numbers were down. We had line ups of less than 5 minutes on most rides. The rain held off until 3pm and we'd been able to go through all of the park by that time and we were going back over rides we wanted to do again. Once the rain started we found that most people huddled under their umbrellas, where as we went on all the undercover rides over and over.I totally recommend HKDL, just keep in mind it is smaller and slower paced than other Disney parks.",Disneyland_HongKong
668798543,5,2019-4,China,"This Disneyland is a lot of fun. There are many rides that are good like the Iron man experience, hyperspace mountain, the toy story car, and many others. I went to Shanghai Disneyland as well and that one is so crowded you can   t go on a lot of rides but in Hong Kong we were able to ride almost every ride in a day. Lines were very short and the park is small so it   s easy to get around. ",Disneyland_HongKong
668777351,4,2018-12,Australia,"We have been to Disneyland in LA two times, and Tokyo Disneyland Disney Sea. Walking through the gates at HK Disneyland felt like going back to LA. This is because the park is owned by Disney and HK Government. We loved the quietness of HK Disneyland in the morning, most things in HK don't open until 10am, so to walk in with very few people in front of us was great. Toy Storyland doesn't open until 11am. We purchased our tickets online from Australia and printed them before we left. You are sent an email with a link to an electronic version with QR codes and personalised characters, but we used the printed version much easier and the website can be a little slow. We also purchased the Dining Vouchers as well, this entitled us to Lunch or Dinner a popcorn or a iceblock. If you are there for two days, like we were then just double the number of vouchers you purchase. HK Disneyland uses the old style Fast pass system, scan your ticket and get a printed fastpass. We were staying at Disney Explorers Lodge and received fast passes to certain rides from there as well. The food in HK Disneyland is aimed at the Asian Market, although there are restaurants who serve burgers etc. If you have fussy eaters then beware you may have limited choices, but over all the food was Disney quality. We ate at the Starliner Restaurant at Tomorrowland.We loved Space Mountain with the Star Wars overlay, sooo coool. The is no Pirates of the Caribbean ride, sad, but the Lion King show and Mickey's PhilharMagic shows are great fun.Unique to the HK Disneyland is Mystic Manor, an amazing trackless ride so fun we went on it three times, the Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars is great fun, the experience varies depending on where you are sitting, we had front row, amazing, and last row, still fun but a little rough. Also unique to HK Disneyland is the Iron Man Experience, a ride simulator on a Stark Industries flyer through Hong Kong. Lots of fun.When you ride the Jungle Cruise remember to choose the English line or Cantonese line as the skippers script is done in both. They say there is no difference in the line waiting time, we didn't really notice it.Yes HKL Disneyland is smaller than LA Disneyland  Tokyo Disneyland but two days allows you to see pretty much everything and not a break net speed. We are a Disney loving family and our girls were aged 17, 15, and 10 when we attended the park. The Christmas decorations and the parade were great.HK Disneyland is on the MTR line just change at Sunny Bay Station for the Disneyland line. You can use your Octopus Card to travel on the MTR. There are shuttle buses that run from the Disney Hotels to the transport hub at Disneyland and you can walk if you want to along the bay from the hotels. It would be roughly 20 minutes walk from the Disneyland Hotel along the bay. There is also a ferry that runs from Central to HK Disneyland but the MTR train is the best option in my opinion, especially as it has Mickey Shaped Windows and Disney theming inside the train carriages.",Disneyland_HongKong
668611003,4,2019-4,Australia,Australian family of four with 2 kids (12 and 9) enjoyed a full day out at Hong Kong Disneyland with plenty to do and see.If you have been to other Disney's and get a chance to visit Hong Kong   I say definitely do it. There are a couple of unique Hong Kong experiences including two Marvel attractions   Antman and Ironman   both which we enjoyed.For thrill seekers there are a couple of great rides   The Big Grizzly Mountain was probably our favourite   it was unexpected and fast. And the RC Racer in Toystoryland definitely worth the wait.For families with younger kids there is heaps here to do   we kind of skipped fantasyland   but for young families you would probably spend a lot of the day here.The park is easy to get to as well   the dedicated Disney train line was fun to ride on   and with an easily navigable MTR in Hong Kong it was simple and cheap to get to the Park.,Disneyland_HongKong
668374644,4,2019-4,United Kingdom,"If your are travelling to Disney land from mong cok you can purchase your tickets from one of the travel shops at a discounted rate (we purchased ours from Hong Thai travel) this is in the bank centre on Nathan road, right next to the Mong Kok station.   if you go to level 4 there are numerous travel shops (including CTS) which from other reviews that I read is where most people purchased the tickets. We asked around the shops on level 4 for the price of their Disneyland ticket (including CTS) and we found Hong Thai travel the cheapest. The tickets were $557HKD each for adults. I would recommend asking around each shop for their price on the day. They seem to all open at 10am. The sales advisor will hand you a letter which you then take to the box office at Disney land and swap for entry tickets   it was very easy and we had no problems. Hong Thai travel Bank centre Nathan roadAs the park opened at 10.30am we decided to get a taxi on the way there, this costs roughly $200HKD from Mong Kok and takes around 20 minutes.On the way back we used the trains, the route is:Disney land to Sunny Bay (pink line)Sunny Bay to Lai King Station (orange line)Lai King Station to Mong Kok (red line)The trains costs are around $20HKD and takes roughly 1 hour.  if you want to catch the train to Disneyland from Mong Kok the route is;Mong Kok to Lai King Station (red line)Lai King Station to Sunny Bay Station (orange line)Sunny Bay Station to Disneyland (pink line)",Disneyland_HongKong
668242919,4,2019-4,Australia,"Hong Kong is easy to get to via the MTR from Kowloon, great signage and fast. Our day started well but just after arriving it started to rain quite heavily and didn't stop until mid afternoon. Characters were out in the main street but only saw two during the day, probably due to the rain. Even though the crowds on entry were big once inside it didn't seem crowded at all, Toy Story Land was a ghost town with no one going on the rides in the rain. We enjoy the rides that were open and all in all had a good day. Had heard great things about Mystic Manor but found it just okay, loved Hyperspace Mountain, Ant Man and Ironman. Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine cars were my favorite of the day! Though shopping wasn't as good as Disneyland in the USA which was disappointing, catering mainly to children. Happy to have visited but don't think I'd go to Hong Kong again.",Disneyland_HongKong
668209978,5,2018-9,Australia,You have to visit to understand the memorable experience. It is a place that brings out the child in everyone. You have to stay for the fireworks. Food is expensive so take snacks along.,Disneyland_HongKong
668111738,5,2018-6,Hong Kong,"HKDL got different event for different period. Like Jan Feb for Chines New Year, Apr May for Spring Carnival, then Summer, Halloween and Christmas, each event got different theme for both charaters costume and decorate, and sometimes might got the special daily parade too. Thats why recommend to check clearly which event you want to join before you make the disney trip. If you don't like crowded, Mar & November without any event happening will be your choice!",Disneyland_HongKong
667962395,3,2019-4,United States,The park is great if this is the only amusement park available to you. It is small and the rides are very tame. The park can be done in 3 4 of a day. Disney is always clean and has the best customer service.,Disneyland_HongKong
667949538,5,2019-4,Australia,"Visited here with the family and had a very memorable experience. It didn   t seem as big as Anaheim, but very clean and well maintained.  Received priority queuing passes but didn   t need them as the lines were very short.",Disneyland_HongKong
667897767,4,2019-3,Philippines,"It's always going to be fun at Disneyland. These are a few of my reminders: don't bring selfie sticks and huge tripods you can bring bottled water or if you have a reusable container, use that instead food can be expensive so eat plenty before going here. Just don't ride the rollercoasters right away. don't miss the Festival of the Lion King Show. You can forget the Moana production though if you're expecting the songs from the movie and to see Maui wear comfortable shoes. there will be lots of walking have fun and don't get discouraged by long queues. you'll have your turn sooner than you think.",Disneyland_HongKong
667633252,4,2019-2,United States,"To be honest it rained nearly all day, if the weather was better i'm sure my overall impression would have been much better. It lacks the thrill seeking rides of other disney parks. That being said it also lacked the ridiculously long quees. Waits were around 5 minutes! ",Disneyland_HongKong
667600609,4,2018-10,United Kingdom,"A super small but cute Disney park   if you're a Disney fan you tick this park off in a day though, be warned, if you're used to the service in Walt Disney World and Disneyland, it doesn't seem to  translate  as well at Hong Kong Disneyland. The food is also not as good   we had lunch from the Lucky Nugget Saloon, which was mediocre at best.A fun day though, regardless.",Disneyland_HongKong
667509247,4,2019-4,United States,"Plaza Inn was fantastic, and the kids in our group loved the rides. It   s smaller than Disneyland, but if you love Disney, it   s worth the visit. If you   re not super into Disney, I   d probably skip and just go to Disneyland in Anaheim.",Disneyland_HongKong
667288224,5,2019-3,Australia,"We first did Disneyworld in Orlando some 40 yrs ago with our 2 year old.Back then, we had to buy different value tickets for various rides whereas that has changed and the entry fee now covers all rides etc, except for food. What hasn   t changed. The place is remarkably clean and well maintained given the number of visitors they see each day. Some rides had a long wait ie 40 minutes, so skipped them till later in the day ie 4 5pm, and the wait period was down to less than 10minutes.A very full day. We got there around 10.30 am and left when the street parade finished at around 9.15pm. Exhausting, but simply loved it ",Disneyland_HongKong
667095433,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,"Had a great time at Disneyland. Great, but can be busy on Saturday and Sunday. Only point to note, is that the park opens at 10:00 but the first zone does not open until 10:30. I purchased priority tickets, if going at the weekend I would recommend priority tickets. Queues smaller during the week and not sure if priority needed.",Disneyland_HongKong
667093819,4,2019-4,Australia,"We had a terrific time at Disneyland HongKong   rides were fun, waiting times ok, shows were enjoyable, very clean, staff super friendly   only let down was average food but to be expected.",Disneyland_HongKong

667072981,3,2019-3,Australia,"Good to see while here, but very small. Great if we brought the children, but not for adults who have been to other ones. Not exciting for bigger children either.",Disneyland_HongKong
667023629,5,2019-4,United States,"I love Disney, I even worked at Disney World in college so when we came to Hong Kong I knew we had to visit. I didn't visit the one in Paris when I went and I regret it. Hong Kong Disneyland is the smallest of the Disney Parks. We were able to ride all the rides in 3 hours when we first arrived at 9:30 a.m. I loved the Wondrous Book of Mickey and the Mystic Manor ride. I also liked the new Ant Man and Wasp ride b c it's like the Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger's ride in Orlando. I also liked how all the characters were dressed up for Easter and the Easter decorations they had up as well. I loved both parades, the afternoon and the night time one reminded me of the Electro Magic Parade that was in Orlando.

666934099,5,2019-4,Singapore,"Small disneyland catering to kids, but they have some nice rides including the new Ant Man ride. Pricey food and somewhat long queues but that is part of the theme park.

666902517,4,2019-4,Indonesia,"It was very essay to go from the city to Disney central Station. We bought tickets on sight with the additional VIP Status so that we didn't have to line up.It was a week day and the park was not full  it was heaven. My only downside to the experience was that the main castle that appears on all their publicity was under reparation and it was very hard to find a restaurant with a variation of vegetarian food unless you liked pop corn, corn on the cob or a vegie burger in one of their fast food outlets. We really enjoyed our selves and so will you. Mind you I am 50 and my friend is 30 something...so it works for adults as well.",Disneyland_HongKong

Book online from klook app to get discount. This only saves time as on spot booking as long que.3. Always reach disneyland by its special metro train as its interior is superb and gives you great feel.4. Take map or use free wifi to access their app for show timings and ride schedule.5. Do not miss any of the live shows as they are worth watching and direction is highly creative.6. Always ask from disneyland employees at ride entrance exit for stickers as they usually keep and gives it for free as soveniour, even when you leav door person can also give you some JUST REMEMBER TO ASK POLITELY.Rest this is worth visiting and whatever age group you belong you cannot miss DISNEYLAND LA LA LAND!!!",Disneyland_HongKong

Better check which amusements are under renovation as usually it has 1 or 2 parks under construction everyday. If this is your last item in HK tour you can check in luggage at Kowloon station and visit Disneyland. But recommend to reserve two day ticket if you want to try out all excursions.

665910063,4,2019-3,United States,My son and his wife and three children recently visited Disney HK. They had a great time exploring it and said there were virtually no lines!!The one fault they found was in the food. Children   s food was very lacking in variety and taste. Our grandson who must be gluten free had no selections on the children   s menu that he could eat. They had to purchase a $60 steak that was not the best either. They have frequented Disney in the US and it is very conscious of allergies and gluten free menu items are readily available. I would implore the Hong Kong ownership of this American icon to be more sensitive to these needs and make some much needed improvements to their menus.,Disneyland_HongKong

665245861,5,2019-4,Indonesia,"Who wouldn   t enjoy Disneyland? Hong Kong Disneyland is really easy to access. They have special metro to Disneyland and special designed. You better get there before 10 and directly queue until the parks open (at 10), so once it open you can enjoy many rides without long queue. Just be there on weekdays, avoid weekends!For muslim traveler, you shouldn   t be worry since you can find halal restaurant inside called Tahitian Terrace. It is located close to Tarzan   s Treehouse. The price ranges from 120 150 HKD if i   m not mistaken. I enjoy big rides but avoid big thrill drop. I   ve tried almost all rides except Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. Shame, i   m afraid of fast backward drop lol.

665132719,5,2019-4,Uganda,"We bought a package through the Disney website. We started at the Explorers lodge and the package included several priority passes (like fast passes). We actually never needed to use them because the longest wait time for a ride was 10 minutes. All of the shows and rides are in English and most cast members speak English really well. This park is the smallest of Disneyland parks in the world, but we still felt like there was enough to keep us busy for our day and a half that we were there. The bus shuttles were very clean and ran on time.Would definitely go again next time we are in Hong Kong.",Disneyland_HongKong

664668402,2,2019-4,Singapore,"I went to HK Disneyland on 5 April which happens to be Qing Ming festival and did not expect the massive crowds on that day. Queues for rides and F&B outlets were very long and we did not have a great experience especially with a young kid. For the amount spent on the tickets, it's really a waste of money as we only sat on a few rides. I'm wondering if the park has any cap on the number of guests in the park as we had a hard time finding seats around. I booked my tickets via the Disneyland Hotel online but there was no info or confirmation given to me whether my park tickets are booked. In the end, I was unable to enter and had to buy tickets on the spot. Luckily, one of the cast members, Carmen, helped us to resolve the issue and let us access without queuing up again. Also the balloons there are overrpriced   HK150 for a helium balloon.",Disneyland_HongKong
664665673,5,2019-4,Canada,We have been to LA and Florida Disney MANY times so we were told we would be disappointed with this one. Not at all! We loved it. It had different rides and shows while still having the same layout and Disney feel. It is expanding a whole lot at the moment. My suggestion would be to add more food restaurants as the food lines were as long as the ride liens. We purchased online tickets and bought a partial ride upgrade. We wanted the full ride upgrade but it was sold out for the day. IMHO it is well worth it! We spent opening to closing there and loved it. The midway games were fun,Disneyland_HongKong

664378631,5,2019-4,India,"Everyone loves Disneyland !!! If you are traveling with young kids I would really recommend staying at one of the three Disney hotels. The hotels provide coaches, thereby making it more convinient. We stayed at the Disney hotel for two nights, the high point being the visit by the Disney characters at breakfast .  We also took a two day pass, it made the whole experience more relaxed and easy going.  Vegetarian food is only available at one of the restaurants. But the taste and quantity is good.  The park itself is well designed. There are enough options to engage very young kids to older kids.  The parade is not to be missed, as well as the different photo opps with all the Disney characters.  Other than the rides my kids really enjoyed the opportunity to dress up as young Jedi   s n fight the evil forces . A great family vacation. ",Disneyland_HongKong
664132845,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,"This was a true highlight of our trip, they suspend reality so well in the park each lands attention to detail is incredible in decor, the sounds   smells, the staffs costumes and personas. There is truly something for everyone of all ages. The lines where very well managed with even on opening day of the new marvel ride just around 40 mins wait. Make sure you use smart fast track passes where you can they are free at some rides.It   s fair to say this park is much smaller than the others but somehow in that it becomes so much more charming.The staff could not do more for people bending over backwards they clearly love their jobs. They just seemed to intuitively just know what people needed.Would strongly recommend anyone with a day or two to spare. The current two day ticket offer was great for us as we did most of the flagship rides day one and the show and on the second day the other items.With this very close proximity to the airport and cheap bag storage it   s an ideal place to stop over or visit on your last day like we did heading straight to the airport after.

664091514,5,2019-4,United States,Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely a must see. It is a smaller park but what it loses in size it makes up for in quality. Hong Kong is currently home to the only Marvel themed rides and they do not disappoint. Hong Kong has many of the standard rides shows you expect from Disney but it also maintains a variety of exclusives. Hong Kong also has a lot of exclusive merchandise especially pins. Also most if not all of the rides are Bilingual. ,Disneyland_HongKong
663693003,5,2019-4,United Kingdom,"Buy your discounted tickets on Klook (thus no ticket queueing when you arrive), get the MTR to Disneyland (35 mins from Hong Kong station where we had breaky at the Pret A Manger in the shopping mall there.). Take in lots of water as it   s expensive in the park. We also took in kids food and snacks as they are expensive and not great quality, you get searched on entry by if you have a good bag with many compartments, it   s easy to hide! Get there at 1015am latest and when the gates open at 1030am go straight for the Star Wars or ToyStory area. Only 2 or 3 rides have the fast pass, if you want to go to the Winnie the Pooh, use it there as the queue was long. Toy story land was great and big queues for the green parachute ride, so that   s one to go to first if you don   t start with Star Wars. The 245pm street show was very good (no need to get there early) but we were disappointed not to see the lion king show that is not currently on (download the free Disney HK App   will tell you what   s happening when). The Lion King show is a not to miss apparently and you have to get there before the street show ends or you might not get in. Recommend the musical show in the big Theatre, that   s next to the Small world. Saw the 1230pm show with lots of singing and Mickey Mouse and goofy !Our highlight of the day though was Mine train  amazing. Went on it 5 times.All in all, a good long day out   too tired to stay for the 730pm lights show !",Disneyland_HongKong

663443693,4,2019-4,Australia,This was our first family trip to Disney as a family (hubby and I have been to LA before we had kids). We left the hotel at 8.30 am even though the park didn   t open until 10.30. I   m glad we did as it took a little while to get there and get tickets etc. We bought the Priority line pass for an extra HKD$299 but it was a big waste of money as the park wasn   t busy and we only had to wait once for a ride. As the park wasn   t busy there were many food shops that were not open. Our kids (13 and 10) loved the rides and went of a few of them several times. My 10 year old cried when we were leaving as she didn   t want to go   so she must of had a good day! It was long and our feet hurt by the end of the day because of all the walking but it was definitely worth it to see the kids having such a good time.

Having just gone to Tokyo Disneyland in February and comparing with this one in Hong Kong, I would say that this is a smaller theme park. However, they have packed quite a lot of activities and rides into a smaller area so there are still a lot to do for a day. In fact, Hong Kong Disneyland is newer and has more updated areas such as Iron Man and the upcoming Ant Man. Not very crowded when we were there during a week day but there are still short queues for the rides.The parades during the day and night were similar with most Disneyland but shorter and not as many floats.

Space Mountain was very tame compared to all other versions.I'm serious about my Disney parks but struggled to fill two days here   I'd recommend only visiting for one day.The highlight was the shows   the Lion King show and the Wondrous Book were the best quality shows I've seen in any Disney park.

We purchased our tickets onsite and used the online 10% discount for foreign travelers just by showing the web page and our drivers licenses. Much easier than buying online. I downloaded the app and it was great as a map and to track wait times for the rides. Most rides had 5 to 40 min waits. I recommend getting the fast pass for Dumbo as it was the only line that took MUCH longer than the advertised wait time. We were able to get on all the rides and still make it back on the MTR at a decent time but the train was pretty packed.

662233037,5,2019-3,United Kingdom,"We tried to buy our tickets online the day before but after entering payment details it said try later. We tried with a different card and it still gave the same message. The credit card company said the payment was taken but we had not received a booking confirmation. We took a taxi from TST area and it was not expensive and in an air conditioned car it was a pleasant journey. We arrived about 10:30. The next day at the park we had to waste time at guest relations where we were told the payments had not been taken, so we bought our tickets at the park. We will need to check our card statements to ensure no payments have been taken!We did not know if we should add the priority pass to our tickets as there was no information on how long the queues were at the entrance, unlike parks we have visited in the US, so we purchased them.Whilst at The Iron Man ride the priority cards were scanned on entry then scanned again before getting on. This is where two of the priority rides were recorded as used but it should only have been recorded as once   we did not know this at the time. When we tried to use our priority pass for the 3rd time later we were told we had none left. This was very embarrassing in front of the other park Guests. We said it could have occurred at Iron Man as they scanned it twice and was told to go back to Iron Man! We were tired by this point from going around the park and did not want to walk back there and so said we would go to Guest Relations instead. Guest Relations were not apologetic. We were offered the priority ticket for our next visit but we are from the UK and do not expect to return! We were offered a soft drink or popcorn   whoopy dah! We had just had lunch   no thank you. So we left with it not being resolved to our satisfaction.Please be careful if you buy online and if you have purchased a priority pass!The queues were about 15 30 minutes.We did have a great time at Disney but the pre purchase and priority pass experiences have left us feeling dissatisfied rather than elated and we still need to check payments had not been taken, so our negative Disney experience continues, even once back in the UK for the next few weeks.",Disneyland_HongKong

661955342,3,2019-3,Australia,"We were disappointed with HK Disneyland. The train wasn't running and the Castle was under renovation, as were several other areas. It had an air of dilapidation. Our coach driver advised us to take food in, not in our bags, which would be searched, but in our pockets. The reason for this was that They want to make you pay the incredibly high prices for food they sell. He also suggested not buying souvenirs there, but taking a picture, then getting the item from Ali Baba (or Ali Express I suppose). A basic souvenir mug cost A$20 approx, and watches were about A$80. The parade though, was fantastic, and made up a lot for the rest of it. It's on twice a day, in the afternoon and evening. The fireworks that we'd previously seen there were suspended for a while, due to the renovations. An MTR station is right there at the gates   change at Central for other lines. There's also a ferry but it limits you to certain times of leaving, so MTR, taxi or bus is better. For a senior, HK$2 on the Oyster Seniors card gets you all the way back to a station close to your hotel, so don't bother with a tour. ",Disneyland_HongKong

Love seeing my little one enjoying Disneyland. ",Disneyland_HongKong

I have previously been to Disneyland Anaheim, Disney World Florida, Disneyland Paris, Tokyo Disneyland Disneysea. HK Disneyland is tiny, but fortunately not many crowds. The haunted house (mystic manor) was weird, though. I would expect something along the lines of other Disneyland parks, but yeah maybe it   s a cultural thing (nothing beats haunted house in Universal Studios Singapore during Halloween Horror Nights, fyi). Overall, my kids had fun there. Main reason why we went to Disneyland.",Disneyland_HongKong

Hyperspace mountain, grizzly mountain, jungle cruise, Mystic Manor and Iron man experience are a must do rides. better to buy tickets food combos from klook. you do not have to stand in queue. just scan barcode and enter. Also, most importantly, take your food coupons just after entry so that you do not ahve to return later to get the coupons. We went to Royal Banquet hall for food. average food. carry water bottle as water is expensive there.",Disneyland_HongKong

660325857,5,2019-3,Hong Kong,"I've seen many negative posts and comments on HK Disneyland in the past. It is really not that bad. Yes, it is expensive and small but it has tons of rides for all ages.As an HK resident, I always go to Hk Disneyland and the experience is the same every time. Whether it is the parade or the rides, the park is incredible. There has been tons of revamps in the past few years with the farewells to Autopia and Buzz Lightyear Astroblasters but has been replaced with a brand new section in Tomorrowland featuring Iron Man and Ant Man coming in April as well as a brand new revamp of Space Mountain. The staff are extremely helpful and the gift shops have loads of merchandise and souvenirs. The park is also extremely kid friendly. The only negative I can extract from this park is the food price. The food isn't that bad but for it's quality, it is way too expensive. Since visitors aren't allowed to bring food in, you might have to starve for a day or buy an expensive meal.If you have lots of free time in HK and want something enjoyable whether with the kids or with your mates, HK Disney is a great park although if you are a major thrill seeker, Ocean Park would be more suited for you.",Disneyland_HongKong

There was construction with a lot of noise during our visit. It was ridiculous to visit the enchanted forest when you heard a jackhammer!! The maneges are limited. The prices are high for the quality of the park. It is better to keep your money and invest it in another activity ",Disneyland_HongKong

To avoid rushing back with other visitors, I tried staying back after the last parade and got on the MTR after most of the visitors had left.The theme park provide strollers for rent, be careful not to lose the deposit slip or they wouldn't cash your deposit when you return the strollers.My kids enjoyed every parade especially the last one at 2000 hrs, with all the lightworks and Disney characters out on the street.",Disneyland_HongKong

My favourite ride was the Mystic Manor   it has nothing to do with Disney, but a great little story which is a bit funny and has amazing detail in the ride. I believe it   s for HK only so really special. The run away train is quite deceiving, it starts of slow and you start to think it   s a bit rubbish...but it then surprises you. A winner with us. We got our tickets with Klook as this was by far the cheapest. It even came with the option for a meal deal which was did as it mean we didn   t have to worry about that. The food at Disney wasn   t great but ok. They are working on the castle at the moment and think it may take a while. At the moment it   s tiny! We found it so odd seeing the castle like this, but it   s because they didn   t have the money to build a bit castle. They do not so fireworks at the moment because of this but they are doing a light show at Main Street which was good. HK Disney has a toy story land, built before the one in Orlando. It   s really good but I love toy story. ",Disneyland_HongKong

This park does not open until 10.30am, but we arrived earlier as we decided to buy our ticket on the gate rather than do this by phone. Surprisingly enough it was a very easy and quick process, just had to show our passportsWe got on the metro from Hong Kong to Sunny Bay station, crossed the platform to catch the Disneyland train which was only one stop.Seeing that this was a Monday the amount of people waiting for the park to open was massive, bug bear is that nearly everyone is on their phones and then you have to put up with them doing a 101 selfies. (please if you love yourself that much just get a mirror). Anyway the announcement was NOT TO RUN when they opened the gates, BUT WHAT did they all do RUN, no manners at all, push and shoved.This park is not a patch on the original Disney in Florida. There are very few rides and you can get round this park so quick. This is certainly not worth the   60 plus for adults .The atmosphere is certainly not here either, maybe because it was not very warm.",Disneyland_HongKong

It   s the happiest place on earth, and it   s great.It is a small park, at least by Anaheim and Tokyo standards, and can be easily covered in a few hours. This leaves plenty of time for shopping and hitting the rides you like multiple times.We came on a Tuesday in early March and arrived at park open. The weather was nice out, but the lines were, thankfully, almost non existent. Even after the usual busy times of 1 2pm, most lines were less than 15 mins.We bought a priority pass, but in hindsight it wasn   t at all required. In the end we just used it to get the value, but we were really just skipping 5 minute queues, so it was a waste of money on this particular occasion.

There are enough rides and attractions to make the trip worthwhile, and it is very easily accessible by the MTR Trains. Main disappointment Wes that there were no characters strolling thru the park to mingle with visitors. That may be because of overcast and potentially rainy skies. In any case, the weather also kept lines for rides very short   5 to 19 min max. No fast pass needed. I also like this Disneyland because you can still visit all the variety of parks paying one fee.

It's said that it's only available in Hong Kong, no other Mystic Manor in any other Disneyland. So we had to go there! Although it wasn't a thrilling ride, it was still fun & very amusing for us.

They have fewer attractions crammed into a small space like the original. Overall the park is clean, themed well and all the cast members we came into contact with were pleasant. I don't think you can compare Disney parks to each other, it's just not fair. I like the HK version although a lot of the attractions were mirror images (or very close) to rides in other Disney parks. Although they are branching out with the Iron Man Experience (think Star Tours with Iron Man) and the new Ant Man and Wasp attraction (which was not yet open when we went in February 2019.) Mystic Manor is HK's answer to the Haunted Mansion. It has a compelling story with a character (Albert the monkey) that draws you in and it has great effects. HK DL is almost worth it just for this one attraction, we rode it twice. Although not as big as FL and not as detailed as Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely worth a visit.",Disneyland_HongKong

Tables not being cleared.Two of the restaurants were shut, a number of the rides were closed, the castle was shut.At HK$620 it was not worth the money.

IF you come first thing in morning, you will be occupied for the whole day.The biggest attraction is the Parade and don't miss the last parade in night   feast for your eyes. My family and my kid enjoyed it thoroughly",Disneyland_HongKong
655891314,5,2019-1,New Zealand,"HK Disney is the smallest of the Disney Parks and definitely something you can cover in a day. We contemplates doing a VIP tour as we had done in WDW, but left it too late to book and in the end glad that I didn't waste my money here as it just wasn't needed unless you were to go on one of the Chinese holidays.We stayed in HK central and took the train out which was easy to do with them running every few minutes, it really didn't matter if you missed one. Even the return at night despite all the people it was frequent enough that there was never a significant wait. The People are somewhat pushy though it's some form of FOMO(fear or missing out). The train doors open people push in and out. If you finish one ride it seems you need to run to the next one so you can get ahead of 2 people. Rope drop which would normally allow a flow of people into the park was more like the starting gun of the New York Marathon.That said, we loved the park. Favorite ride is Phantom Manor, similar type of ride to Ratatouille in France but with some magical effects. The light show at night is also worth staying to check out.As a tall person 6' 4  I did find myself having to contort myself into seats to fit my legs in. Same thing with Tokyo, but you can fit. I found crossing my legs and moving my feet as far back in the seat as I could before sitting down made a difference.The Lion King show was amazing so I would put that down as a must!",Disneyland_HongKong
655849465,3,2019-2,United Kingdom,"I   m a big Disney fan so was super excited to visit HK Disneyland. Although we had a fun day.. I can   t help but feel disappointed. The park was very small and I feel the price is extortionate when comparing it to Disneyland Paris   which is much larger and significantly cheaper. I found that it didn   t have the magic of Disney and it just felt like any old theme park. The staff were not particularly friendly and they didn   t engage with guests at all   in fact, I was ignored by a group of 3 staff members! Having said this.. mystic manor is quite possibly my new favourite Disney ride ever   you really have to go on it!! ",Disneyland_HongKong

We thought that the park will be packed since is the holiday season but luckily the park is moderately packed.My thought about this place is a great place to spend your day in your HK trip. The park is very nice and it was smaller than your typical Disney park. Compared to other Disney park I've ever visited, this theme park has shortest waiting time especially for thrill seeker attraction and of course no need to check all the fast pass.You can download the apps beforehand to check the schedule for the parade, map, and waiting time for each attraction. Unfortunately in our visit, the Sleeping Beauty castle is still under construction but we managed to enjoy Disney Christmas Celebration.In our visit, We managed to enjoy 6 rides, 1 parade, 2 shows in our 4 hours of visit. If You're a thrill seeker, don't forget to enjoy the two attractions exclusive in HK Disneyland, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars and Mystic Manor. For a magical time of great fun, you can   t go wrong with Hong Kong Disneyland!",Disneyland_HongKong

Crowds were OK for mid week and winter. Cost HK619 for the day each adult. We ate in the explorers club restaurant and had an Asian curry which was OK although a bit bland to cater for all tastes.

654876699,4,2019-2,United States,"I personally haven't gone to a Disneyland outside of California so I didnt know what to expect. The cultural ties to the Chinese culture that they implemented at the park was simply amazing. This is probably the only park where Mickey can speak Cantonese. The park is very clean, it was smaller than your typical Disney park. There are various shows you can watch throughout the park. The rides are similar to what you would find in California. I believe the Iron Man attraction might be unique to HK. The park was busy but not to the point where we had to wait hours for a ride. It averaged 30 minutes or so per ride. If you're looking to experience something different from Disney, this would be the place to go. We only went for the day and was able to go on everything we wanted to go on. Just keep in mind that this park is smaller. I would not recommend coming here during Chinese New Year or Golden Week.",Disneyland_HongKong
654875575,4,2018-12,United Kingdom,"First time I've been to Disneyland, so I have no benchmark for comparison. Smaller than I expected, but big enough to fill a full day for two adults.

The Disney train was very cool, and had a real air of excitement...Join Mickey and Minnie for the day and enjoy :)",Disneyland_HongKong

It   s a close replica of the Anaheim Disneyland but smaller without some of the big kid rides. PROs:1) For a Disney park, it   s not very crowded. I love Tokyo Disney Sea but the crowds really kill the experience there. People in Hong Kong apparently do not wake up early even when the park opens at 930am. There   s really are no lines for the first couple hours. Even during the busiest hours, the lines are moderate. 2) I love the variety of foods from all different regions. I actually looked forward to meals. 3) When we were there, they were 6 different times for the Jedi training and it was never full. 4) Admission tickets are so much cheaper than any other Disney park in the world. You can use apps like Klook to buy discount tickets and discount meals. If your children are under 7, this really is the perfect Disney experience. ",Disneyland_HongKong
654630865,3,2018-3,Australia,There is some wonderful excitement built on the train ride to Disneyland with the cute Mickey themed carriage.

The lines were a bit too long and a lot of people. During the parade, the Disney employees who were in charge to keep the crowd away from the floats were cranky and ill mannered. Disneyland is really a beautiful place. There were restaurants and food carts at every corner. The restrooms were all big and clean.

I personally think the entry ticket is quite pricey, but it's all paid off with incredible attractions. It's truly magical! If you are family with kids, it's a must visit place, you can meet almost all Disney characters, and don't forget to capture your moments, there are so many beautiful photo spot to be captured. Suggestion: you'd better come in the morning, since the weather is not too hot and there will be more crowded in the afternoon. And if you are not in rush, be sure to see the parade or the fireworks show in the night (about 30 minutes before the closing time), that's really worth the wait, and I can say that's one of the best show I have ever seen.",Disneyland_HongKong

As you   d expect lots of Disney themed stuff going on, the train with Mickey shaped windows, hanging hand grips Mickey shaped, various statues of characters in the carafes. We went in February on a damp day. Not overly busy, with queue times between 0 and 10 minutes without any kind of priority boarding ticket. Having been to Disney Land Paris and Walt Disney World in Florida I was still hugely impressed and couldn   t stop smiling for the whole visit. A real mixture of East and West themes going on, similar in so many ways but different enough to make it still feel new. There was some building work going on around the castle and as a result the train wasn   t working though that didn   t detract from the day. Log in to the Disney Land Wi Fi and we got a HK$10 voucher. Thoroughly enjoyed Toy Story Land. The classic area of Tomorrow Land rebranded as Star Wars & Marvel.

You can't quite see everything in 1 day   2 is perfect and 3 just gave us the luxury of time to see everything with time to spare. We were blown away by the shows   Mickey and the Wonderous Book and The Lion King are incredible. Skip Moana if you are on a schedule. Rides aren't that thrilling, but definitely good fun. Disney has this amazing knack for making kids rides that are fun for adults too! Toy Story Land's parachute drop is the best!! Make sure you get there at rope drop to maximise your time in the park. Food is expensive, but good enough. Choose week days for low crowds   we were there 2nd week of Jan and crowds were good. Take the train (MTR)   it's part of the experience and easy to do with some planning. Saved money by buying tickets on klook   easy to use. Often can get a discount vouchers for shops on main street between 10 and 10.30 while waiting for rope drop for rest of park. They can store your parcels and collect at end of day.Consider booking a character meal (e.g. breakfast at Disney hotel) to get those great character snaps  saves you needing to line up during that precious park time!",Disneyland_HongKong

We dropped off our luggage right before the entrance to Disneyland for a reasonable fee there is a special place at Disney to hold your luggage for the day. Small Disneyland compared to Anaheim and Florida but definitely fun to see and experience. The food inside the park was disappointing.

We had pre purchased tickets   and be aware that there is a great senior discount!This was my first Disneyland in Asia, and my understanding is that Tokyo Disneyland is better. Disneyland HK is smaller than the two parks in the US. It was oddly similar, and yet oddly different. The park was clean. Small World was being refurbished when we were there, so we were not able to check it out. Some fun things to note:1. They have Star Wars chopsticks in the Star Wars shop! Wish I'd bought more. 2. We had Indian food for lunch, and it was spicy but good.3. They had the usual Disney signs with rules before you get on a ride, but I don't recall seeing  You should be sober  as part of the instructions in Anaheim or Orlando!

650641639,4,2019-1,United States,"I've gone to both Disney parks in California and Orlando and while HK Disneyland is very small in comparison, I loved how this park won't have you exhausted by the end of the day and still allow for other activities after you've finished your time. This was how I scheduled my time with my friend. 11 am met a friend at Nam Cheong MTR and rode over to the Disneyland Line. A smart thing to do would be to buy your tickets on your phone as you are riding the MTR. (We didn't and wasted some time at the ticket gate)Once we were in we took our rounds of pictures. The first impression was,  Wow, that's the castle? How awful.  Though when I was there they blocked off the castle so they will be making a more robust castle soon from what I'm understanding.In other parks like Japan and the USA, it's all about looking for the snacks all around the park. (Here's looking at you Dole Whip) I need to get this out of the way, the food is awful at HK Disney. This fact really surprised me given that there's so much good food in HK but it really was pretty horrid. Friend and I had some bad lunch and then went along to other rides. Most rides were about a 20 minute wait which I thought was very acceptable. I think the longest wait we had was for Hyperspace Mountain and that was for 40 minutes.Checked out the parade and was actually hoping for Asian women dressed up as Cinderella or Snow White. Nope. God forbid Snow White is an Asian. But I suppose I get it. lolAfter some snack fails and a Philharmagic 3D show we exited the park at around 6 pm. Took the MTR straight to Tsim Sha Tsui for a nice dinner at 7 pm. At 9 pm, friends and I were parked at a whisky bar and then by 11:30 pm I was home in bed.It was one of the most amazing days because this type of Disney excursion never happens in either California or Florida simply give the scale of the parks and also how awful public transportation is in either cities.I wouldn't recommend coming to HK for Disneyland, that would be a let down. However, if you're sightseeing in HK and have time for Disney, it's a no brainer to go.",Disneyland_HongKong

Even though the park isn   t as big as the two in America it   s not missing anything for our 3 year old but it would be lacking in rides and activities for older kids to teens. The classics are there such as It   s a Small World. All in all it was a great trip.",Disneyland_HongKong

When we went back to one of the stores to check if we dropped it there while paying for merchandise the store lady was very rude. She rudely asked bow do we know it's your even if we find it. I asked her how many other people have come looking for their food vouchers, she said none. I couldn't believe how crass these people were. We requested the reception to reprint the voucher since they had bar code and they refused saying they can't. This just shows how backward their technology is. It's not a big deal to reprint the same bar code. If someone had already used our voucher the bar code wouldn't work anyway so no harm in reprinting it.We were there during the Christmas holidays. It was crowded but well organised. Some of the places were closed since they are expanding. The parade was fun and so we're the ride especially star wars and the grizzly gulch.",Disneyland_HongKong

Not even close.The only postive was taking the    train    around the outskirts which told us there wasn   t much to see, less enjoy. Rides were for 10 12yo and under and their parents carers.

If you in HK, do not go to this rip off expensive overpriced park, which is not even worth HK$10 let alone paying over HK$400. There's no attraction, the rides are garbage, no decent food court and the price of the food is three to four time the price. this theme park is just as big as the Victoria Park in HK.Those who are commenting about how wonderful the time they had must have been paid by Disney or high with something.

647569763,4,2018-2,United Arab Emirates,"I visited this superb amusement and theme park two times already. On this last visit , I took my 86 yr old father with me. He enjoyed like a child. The whole area is divided into 7 zones and each of the zones is uniquely planned and designed with the speciality of that zone in mind. Each zone has a ride, a show , an eatery for that area. I loved the Grizzly bears mining area with that stupendous ride!! The zone is planned with hot water geizers and rocky mountainous type. Excellent. Also the space ride area was too good. Starwars themed people were going around. The ride was great. I also liked the Little children's boat rides. The shows were a little less exciting for us. Because it's really for the small kids. There is a nice rail line around the park for easy travel. We bought the online tickets from the website. That made the enty super easy. Also I had the priority pass for us  that's free, my father had the senior ticket very cheap. The passes really helped us to see everything fast. U need to walk around a lot. But lots of resting places and refreshments are available to take it slow. Protect your head with hats.One day finishes like a sweet dream. Interested people can take the two day ticket if so inclined. There is also a hotel inside which can be included in the package. At designated times there are themed festivities, procession and fireworks which attracts lot of crowds. The journey from the city takes around 1 hr. Discounted tickets are available from klook dot com also. Overall, a lifetime dream came true for me. I have been dreaming of going to disneyland from the last 40 yrs minimum. I am very happy.

(Frankly, the queue is scary; unless you go first thing in the morning, or buy  get the fastpass, 1 day is not enough to see ALL the shows  rides... ) Ok, certain things are under renovation   including the well loved Castle, and thus the fireworks at night though never stay that late.Stay for the new Mona show, Lion King show, the favorite Small World ride, the Pooh ride, ...and of course the well loved parade.As usual, magical at least for me to see Mickey and most of the Disney characters.",Disneyland_HongKong

647328225,1,2019-1,Australia,"Visited from Australia. Enjoyed the rides, parades and shows. Disappointed the toy train ride was closed. Knew the castle would be under renovation. The biggest let down was that as we were leaving, we decided to pop by the gift shop to buy a Mickey and Mini Mouse plush toy (in the Chinese outfits) which was under the sign that said 2 for HKD298. When we went to pay, the girl behind the counter said it was HKD168 each. We took her colleague to show her the offer sign and she said it didn   t apply for Mickey and Mini, but that it was for other plush toys (Duffy and friends toys only). The girl was very condescending and made us feel unpleasant. So we accepted and bought it for HKD336. When we left to Hong Kong airport 2 days later, at the Disney store in the airport (we didn   t know there would be one there) we saw the same deal: 2 plush for HKD298 and we asked if it applied to the same Mickey and Mini mouse, and lo and behold the girl at that store said it did! that is, 2 for HKD298!! So how is it that at Disneyland park the store did not honour the offer when the other store did? We were very disappointed that the staff were very rude when we tried to enquire about the offer that was rightly given to everyone at the airport store, but did not give us this offer when it was clearly stated on the stand in the main Disneyland?!? This made what would have been a great day at Disneyland very unpleasant. We have discouraged our family & friends to visit Hong Kong Disneyland due to this unpleasant experience. Disney, we would like you to be more honest in your promotions and to honour what is stated in your pricing. ",Disneyland_HongKong

647135021,5,2019-1,Canada,What else could I possibly say about going to Disneyland that hasn't already been said. A truly magical place. A bit different from the original Disney California. Space Mountain is a combination of Space Mountain and Star Wars. Quite hysterical Hearing R2 D2in your ear while riding in the dark. The haunted house is a combination of Raiders of the Lost Ark style seating and has some of the facts of the haunted house. The jungle cruise is way better then California Disney. The whole Adventure Land is very green and Lush. The Toy Story Land is incredible. Full of lots of great rides. The Thunder Mountain is amazing and much better than California.

We used these for the popular attractions and we lined up basically for 1 2 mins before walking onto a ride.Highlights: grizzly gulch mine car ride, iron man experience and hyperspace mountain.Favourite show: Mickey and wonderous book.Favourite parade: paint the night.Characters: in two days we saw about 15 characters. They seemed to be easier to access than California. They also interacted better. Overall: 1 day is enough for regular travellers. Disney freaks will need 2 days to see everything. We did 2 days and went on major attractions 3 4 times and just took our time. It was much less stressful than California! The castle is getting renovated and will be completed I believe next year.

Plenty of people speak English at least enough to point you in the right direction. Rides were great, food selection is extensive and night activities are well done. It is a long subway ride from Hong Kong then a pretty long walk to front gate. IMPORTANT TIP do not take in any kinds of bags or purses. Put whatever you need in your pockets.

646389071,5,2018-12,United States,"Hong Kong Disneyland has the magic of the Magic Kingdom but is much smaller in size. It is therefore less crowded and easier to navigate. The downside is the quality and price of the food offered in the restaurants and hotels. There is really no other option unless one takes the subway off site It is also hard to find a willingness in the employees to accommodate special diets such as gluten free. Our granddaughter has celiacs and we asked for ice cream in a dish rather than a cone. You would think we had asked for something unbelievably difficult for them to do. They would only give us the ice cream in a cardboard paper french fry container and not in a plastic cup that they used to serve sundaes in. We found this same reluctance to make exceptions when ordering in all of the restaurants there. It was surprising to find this at a place with the Disney brand, especially considering their prices for food. The actual park tickets and hotel tickets were reasonable.",Disneyland_HongKong

A one day ticket will be enough if you are early. Look for a taxi to get to DisneyLand, they are way cheaper than UBER and off from there by 17:00 since it gets very cold around 8 9 Degrees Celsius in December",Disneyland_HongKong

The rides were great, it   s worth getting the fast passes if you can. The best ride by far was the Iron Man ride   although there are much scarier ones! The toy story land was a winner with the kids (especially the hot wheels and soldier rides!) and they also loved the Main Street. The food isn   t great, but we didn   t expect it to be!

But, this time, I think it is worth the price of admission and a great getaway. There's several Hong Kong only rides that you have to do.

645245762,5,2019-1,United Kingdom,"My husband and I had a long layover at the airport, so we left our bags at the Left Luggage counter in Terminal 2 and caught a blue taxi to Disneyland. I   ve visited both Disney parks in the States many times, so I was excited to see the similarities and differences at the Hong Kong park.We arrived around 2:30 pm, and there was absolutely no queue. The ticket counter employee kindly informed us that there was no need to purchase fast pass tickets given the small number of guests at the park that day. And she was right! The longest queue was for 25 minutes for Winnie the Pooh. Otherwise, we walked right on to rides or waited 5   10 minutes. I have never seen a Disney park less crowded (we visited on January 9th).Like all Disneys, the park is charming and well done. There is a LOT of construction right now, including the castle and construction in Tomorrowland. There is a strong focus on photographs   so many character meet and greets and photo opportunities everywhere. Perhaps this is due to the new Instagram focused world we live in. It was fascinating to see so many dressed up guests ready for their pictures   high heels, designer dresses, lipstick, etc. This is not your normal turkey leg eating guest at the Florida park. :)The park appears to be quite small compared to CA Disneyland. We spent about 3.5 hours at the park and we were ready to go (we only rode the majority of the rides once). The roller coasters were a bit more exciting than those in the States   Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars (which looks like Thunder Mountain Railroad) is much more exciting. It was also interesting to see the similarities and differences between Mystic Manor and the Haunted Mansion. There were also a few new rides and experiences that I hadn   t seen in the States.I   m glad we didn   t take a full day out of our initial visit to Hong Kong to visit Disney, but it was the perfect place to spend a long layover.

645088792,5,2019-1,Australia,"Smaller and with much less    challenging    rides than Ocean Park, HK Disneyland nevertheless really delivers.We went to HKDL only a couple of days after OP and thought it might be theme park overkill, but easily managed to keep going from before opening (we arrived 15    prior to 10.30am start) until closing after the final street parade. The family, including 17, 20 and 22 year olds, each had an awesome time. The lines were short (a Thursday in January), the weather perfectly in the Goldilocks zone, the rides fun albeit not too much of a challenge, and the vibe was ideal (how can you not get into it when fully 10 20% of the adult guests are wearing Mickey  Minnie ears or other HKDL headgear?!). I can even recommend forking out slightly extra in buying the combo food package (something I normally eschew), and definitely suggest it   s well worth purchasing online prior to going. If you can only go to one park I   d suggest HKDL on balance (cleaner, easier, fewer queues and less walking), unless you   re after more of a    local    flavour or want more thrill seeking rides. Ideally do both and make your own comparisons. Either way, enjoy the ride!",Disneyland_HongKong

It   s easy to get to (take the train from HK central to Sunny Bay, on the Tung Chung line, then change at Sunny Bay, then the purpose built Disneyland line (Mickey theming literally everywhere!) to the resort. It   s around 600$HK which is around   60 or US$75 for a one day pass, and one day is really all you need. (They do sting you a little on the locker charges though). It has all the Disney touches you   d expect at a Disney park, but it   s very small and compact. I was lucky that the day I visited crowds were low. I never queued more than 10min for anything. Hyperspace Mountain and the Iron Man ride were great, Tomorrowland is probably the best for adult guests. The mine train in Grizzly Gulch is great too. Mystic Manor will seem strange if you   re used to the Haunted Mansion, but it has its own charm. Almost everything is kid friendly and Fantasyland seems to take up a larger proportion of the park than in Florida or California. It was so quiet that some food outlets were closed, but the Skyliner Diner, Explorers and Banquet Hall had good choices and plenty of seating",Disneyland_HongKong

The castle was closed off for refurbishment, so no nice pics of the castle or sounding area, the castle is also only half the size of other disney resorts. The Mickey light show in main street was excellent and very well done but sadly the night show that we waited for was cancelled 2 mins before it was due to start because of about 3mins of a VERY light rain shower. We have visited Florida Disney many times and it is obviously far superior but the main comment I have to say is that every single staff member at Hong Kong looked miserable and that they didn't really want to be there, by comparison Florida staff are bursting with smiles and fun. Not many large rides here and only two fast pass rides. We ate at the Chinese restaurant which was just average food. I would definitely recommend a visit and for those that can 't compare to other Disney parks you'll have a great day out.",Disneyland_HongKong

We booked our tickets online through Klook, which proved effortless as we showed our QR codes to gain enterance and off we went. We were inside the main enterance just after gate opening. We had been to Disneyland California and roughly knew the rides we wanted to get on, so headed straight for them. We rode quite a few of the rides with little to no waiting time and made our way around the park easily picking rides depending on wait time. We only had the 1 day, so if you do too, I suggest you wear comfortable shoes. Yes, it   s a smaller park but there   s still kilometers to walk.

Highly recommend the Grizzly Mine Car and Hyperspace rides. We also watched a few shows and parades. The Lion King show was particular magical, really brings back the kid in us.

Some rides opened early while others opened a little later. The castle was under construction, so that isn't a good picture right now. We did the Ironman ride which was very fun and there was no line at all. It seems that since Shanghai Disney opened it isn't as crowded at Hong Kong Disney. We did all the big rides that we wanted to do and funny enough the longest line was for Jungle Cruise. Haha! Our new favorite ride is Mystic Manor, a new and terrific version of Haunted Mansion. It is really well done! Be sure you see it! We loved the park! We made a reservation at Crystal Lotus but didn't have a cute dim sum reservation so we were not able to get that. I wrote a separate review on that restaurant. We had done the whole park and shopped by 1 pm. As we headed out to go to the Disneyland Hotel around 1pm, the crowds coming in were insane! Apparently everyone arrives late and stays late. So we were very happy to come early and leave early. Happy that we went, and enjoyed it! We got discount tickets from Klook.com in advance.

No lines to buy tickets to get into the park and super quick to walk over to the rides. We were there on a Thursday in January and we didn   t have any lines longer than 5 minutes until around noon. We also got a fast pass for Hyper Space Mountain in the morning to be sure we could come back again later without waiting. I would also recommend downloading the Hong Kong Disneyland app to see wait times and get a map of the park. We ate at the Main Street Corner cafe and the sweet and sour chicken and shrimp and the burgers were really good.

The Mystic Manor ride was good but the queue was abysmal, and not very clearly signposted. The riverboat ride was fantastic, largely because of the guide who deserves either an Oscar or a pay rise for her brilliant commentary. The Runaway Mine Carts ride was extremely good fun, and very well done in terms of safety. Most queues moved surprisingly quickly, and it was all relatively painless, even for a Disney cynic like me.

The on line videos showed Disney characters just walking around the park, interacting with people, making the ambiance of the park more Disney like. This was actually the expectation.

This decision was mainly based on it being a smaller park so a little bit easier on their little legs. They absolutely adored it! My six year old went on every ride (apart from RC Racer due to height) and apart from Mystic Manor (which he found a little scary), he loved them all. The look of delight in my three year old   s face was also sweet. It was a fantastic warmer for the bigger parks in the U.S.A. One day park? Definitely not. We did every single ride (apart from RC Racer and Tarzan   s House) and every single show (apart from Moana) and parades, net characters, did none of the gardens and we just fit it into two days. And we were there from open to close with a stack of fast passes in hand. Maybe we were slowed down due to having little kids with us but I don   t know how people do the park in one day and do it justice. Where the park lost a star was the food and merchandise. The food was gross. That   s all I can say about that. The merchandise? Well unfortunately there were heaps of shops on Main Street but they all stocked exactly the same merchandise. Apart from Pandora which I don   t personally wear, there was nothing for adults. The variety just wasn   t there and the selection that was there was poor. Would I go back?

642538330,3,2018-12,Philippines,"Compare it to universal studios, Disneyland hongkong is overrated! 1. Tickets are Expensive because half of the theme park is under renovation! 2. Food is way too expensive for a no quality product. They should have at least upgrade the taste, serving and of course presentation. 3. Photo ops with mascots is 15 minutes only. They should have additional time or Atleast post the timeline in a map direction for visitor   s reference! 4. Sellers here are rude! They will not give you unless you pay first, (as if you   re not going to pay if you order duh ) 5. Good for kids who don   t like extreme rides. 6. Picture in maze imposed limited time also. We recommend for children but not with teens who enjoy extreme rides! 7. Food and drinks from outside is prohibited. Again, as if the food here is awesomely tasteful! It   s really a waste of money to eat here. NO QUALITY!!!!! But rather pricy.",Disneyland_HongKong
642534419,2,2018-12,Singapore,Our two day visit to Disneyland was a bitter disappointment. The park was so busy you could not move around freely. The average wait time for each ride was 60 minutes. There is no option of a fast pass as is the norm in many other theme parks around the world. We did not see the Disney Princesses for a photo opportunity (which was the only reason my youngest two wanted to go to Disneyland) and all the other photo opportunities were full before we even arrived at the destination. The train around the park only went one way and did not return to its point of departure. The lines for coffee and food resulted in is leaving the park earlier than we anticipated because the wait was too long. A very disappointing experience to say the least and we will not be back! Please do not visit during the Christmas New Year season!,Disneyland_HongKong

The morning crowd is manageable. We manage to get to go twice on some rides. Did not wait more than 30mins at any rides. Easy to walk around. Christmas lightings were up. We saw the parade and it was fun. Snacks stores everywhere. Many shows to watch. Very well organised place. Go on weekdays and it will be great!

They were good too. Also, the castle is currently under construction and the food is quite expensive",Disneyland_HongKong

There lots of stuffs in there   they evenhave Starwars and Ironman ride in there... my kids loved it... Met Mickey & Minie, Goofy, Chipmunks, Donald Duck and Ironman too... ",Disneyland_HongKong
641689558,5,2018-12,Philippines,"Went to HK Disneyland last 17th December 2018 with my wife and 3.5 year old son. Even if it   s not our first time anymore, that magical happy feeling is still palpable.We arrived 10:30AM and as expected, we inevitably spent too much time in the first area around Main Street with so much to do and see, before realizing we had to move on to the other areas and attactions. My son particiularly loved the Toy Story Land area, given his familiarity with the characters there, we even went back there at night for a second time upon his request. We also spent more than an hour lining up to have a picture with Micky Mouse, but the long wait was worth it (had an easier time lining up for Chewbacca & R2D2 earlier).We had lunch and dinner at the Royal Banquet and Explorers Club, respectively. These venues offer great food and are good choices in maximizing your Klook meal coupon (HKD 149 per meal and you just pay the excess if any, plus a free ice cream or popcorn). As usual, lining up for rides was a bit of a challenge, but got easier towards the afternoon, so we just chose the ones that were suitable for our son. We took a lot of great photos all around the park and realized in hindsight that we should have gotten the 2 day pass instead of 1 day to maximize; perhaps we   ll do it next time when our son is older.By 9PM, the Parade of Disneyland characters got underway and my son, no matter how sleepy, perked up especially when he saw Lighning McQueen and Big Mack! It was an eye catching moving light show by all the performers who really looked good glowing in the dark with their LED suits and mobile stages. Then after the Parade, we went to the shops for souvenirs before we finally went back to the hotel via MTR (which fortunately operates until before midnight).Our recommendations: 1. If you really expect to spend the whole day at the park, best to avail of the Klook park entry tickets with meals for savings.2. If your overall HK itinerary can accomodate, consider the 2 day pass instead of 1 day if you really want to maximize all the attractions there without rushing so much (your kids will surely enjoy). Downloading the theme park application will also greatly help because you can conveniently see all the shows and at what time. 3. We suggest also that you print the Klook park entry tickets if possible so that it is easy to present it at the gate because trying to open the e coupons from one   s mobile phone can get confusing and will delay the queue (like what happened in our case). (Using the said e coupons, they will print out the official coupons at the gate which you will use to claim your meals snacks later on.)Hope this review helps!",Disneyland_HongKong
641687100,5,2018-12,Philippines,"I love the attention to design and detail here, along with all the basic great things that happen here   had a great day seeing things and experiencing many rides. Over time I am thinking they should add another park here. This is a solid one day adventure, and two days if you incorporate some rest   I think staying at the Disney hotels would be very good for that. Having come here from California, and been to the Anaheim Disneyland several times, this might somewhat pale in comparison, but still a fun experience.

I was there on a Monday in december and the crowd was sizeable with waits for rides going up to 30 minutes for the more popular ones.

Apart from the rather small Sleeping Beauty Castle being under renovation, what stood out were how small the park was and expensive food. As it was not yet peak visitation and helped by slightly rainy weather (which also ruined some outdoor shows and parades), we managed to cover all the rides and shows we wanted in a day. Of all the attractions, we liked The Festival of the Lion King, Mickey and the Wonderous Book, Iron Man Experience and Mickey   s Philharmagic.",Disneyland_HongKong

We ate a meal there and it was absolutely tasteless, in fact the worst meal i have had for years.We ordered Shabu Shabu from the Japanese outlet. I wanted to order fish & chips from somewhere near the goldmine but the restaurant was closed.Corn on the cob about US$6, ice cream terribly expensive. My wife enjoyed visiting Disneyland, seeing a couple of parades, a couple of shows and many photos but it would have been more enjoyable if we had children. BUT i am sure it would have cost a lot more because they would be wanting ice cream, toys, pop corn drinks etc and i would not have been prepared to pay these ridiculous prices.",Disneyland_HongKong

638478152,5,2018-10,India,"Disneyland is made basically for children but it   s really amazing for adults too. we were there in first few of October and it was not so busy time there, still 2 days are not sufficient to enjoy the whole Disneyland. We enjoyed there every second of the time we spent there. Not only your children, you will not like to come back from Disneyland. Everything is made there is to mesmerise you. Starting from the toy train to meeting the ICONIC Mickey mouse. You can   t forget a single second of your time spent here.Disneyland is divided in 7 sections. In which only two sections have rides, in which fantasyland is for young children and tomorrowland is for adults and teens.Other than rides, you will see, ironman museum with an awesome 7D show. Another 7D show is about Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.   it   s an small world    ride in a boat is simply the most charming. Well I will not say much about other attractions, but all are equally awesome. Park is super clean and well maintained. You won   t find anything which looked dirty or worn out. Staff is very supportive. When we were there HALLOWEEN was around corners, so the whole park was decorated with Halloween theme. Entry fee has just right price tag but rest everything inside is so costly. A half litre water bottle costed 35 HKD. A mickey shaped lighting balloon costs HKD 150. Logically this balloon should cost less than 15 HKD (150INR) in India. Other than attractions, you can also shop there extensively, from a basic T shirt to a great party wear gown, a simple water bottle to soft toys, everything related to Disney is there for sale. Prices are obviously so high. A basic T shirt for 2 yr child was priced for 200 HKD (2000 INR). A doll set of 24 small dolls set back me 400 HKD(4000INR). I have not visited other Disneylands, but this one is so mesmerising that your brain will refuse to forget the instances of Disneyland. Overall it   s a must visit place if you are in Hong Kong.",Disneyland_HongKong
638438046,4,2018-4,Hong Kong,"As a resident of Hong Kong, and very close to Disneyland, we   ve been visiting here often ever since it opened. We used to have yearly passes for the whole family. It is such an awesome escape from the frantic, sometimes    dirty    city life that surrounds it. All the normal Disney characters can be seen plus a number of new (to Disney)    Marvel    characters and Marvel inspired rides. Favourites of our family include the Jungle River Cruise, Grizzly Gulch, It   s a Small World, TeaCup ride, Slinky Dog and Mystic Manor. The staff are almost always friendly and helpful and the shows and parades are ALWAYS jaw dropping and definitely not to be missed. Watch out for the sporadic street performances of the street sweeper drummers who have an amazing drum perscusion show based on their garbage bins and cleaning implements. Also watch out for the    cleaner    who paints (using water) Disney characters literally on the street road. There are only really two possible negatives to the Disney experience. A very limited selection of western style (and quality) foods in some of the Disney resteraunts. Lastly, if it   s a mainland China holiday Disney can be quite unpleasant with the crowds. The best plan is to ALWAYS try and get there for opening time for less queues and crowds. Having said that, the iconic fireworks show is well worth hanging around for. Oh, and get there by train. Disney has its own train station. It   s the cleanest, quickest, cheapest way to get there. Have a GREAT trip to Disneyland. I thoroughly recommend it.",Disneyland_HongKong

Watch out for the time allotted for different shows.The shows were fantastic, the circle of life is even more fantastic.There will be long queue for every show it is an advantage to get a fast pass to escape the long line. Except for picture taking with Minnie and Mickey Mouse you have to endure the long queue because there   s no fast pass for this.The jungle river experience is a must!

That said we had a great time, we brought a 2 day pass as there was not much difference in price of 1 day before we went, we also purchased the food package of 2 meals and a snack. The food you get with this deal is very filling and we struggled to get through all the food we could have. The snack was either popcorn or an ice cream and the meals were full size dinners with soft drink. Everything that we ate was very tasty.Possibly the 1 meal and a snack option would have suited us better.It was very quiet there when we went and hardly had to queue for the rides and didn   t need to use fast passes at all.decorations for Christmas were really good but I was disappointed that there was not much In the way of Disney Christmas ornaments to purchase.All in all we had a great time, I still can   t get over how small the castle is, I thought the one in Paris was small but it   s huge in comparison to the one here.",Disneyland_HongKong

637934986,3,2018-12,China,"Took my daughter to HK Disneyland for her 5th birthday. Disneyland hotels are hugely overpriced, so we booked a hotel outside Disney. The Park itself is beautiful, so are most of the shows  I loved Magic Manor and my daughter loved the Lion King show. The parade was great, but a bit too short. A few things went bad though  lots of waiting for every ride  15 25  minutes. Kids got tired and we gave up on some rides. The food is overpriced and tasted bad  The Main Dining Hall (up to 20 USD for a tasteless meal), food stalls with outdated corn for 4 USD 4, sausages 5 USD. Actually all soft drinks in the Park cost HKD 32 ( 4  USD) and you are not allowed to bring your own food! Another point  it's close to Christmas time, a lot of Christmas music was being played non stop including Church hymns like Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, O Come All Ye Faithful, etc. Sounds too religious, not suitable for kids, a bight of brainwashing so to say. And no wi fi at the park at all.

It helped that we bought our tickets online (and cheaper) as we were able to skip the ticket counters and breezed through the entrance. We were greeted by rows of souvenir shops and rows of cheery greeters before the kids raced towards the rides. Us adults appreciated that there is (already) a Starbucks along the Main Ave which provided a caffeine respite every now and then.

The VIP experience is worth it, especially if the park is busy. Be sure to get the armbands for the parade   you get the best seats possible with no jockeying.5.

Thunder Mountain was my absolute favorite ride (for slightly older kids and adults) and the shows were great! We saw the Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book! Both amazing! The Moana show was ok but Moana didn   t sing so we left. Good food options and lots of lands to explore. Definitely smaller than Disney so if you start early you could see most of the park in a day.

636961092,5,2018-12,India,Our visit to Disneyland was planned solely for son who   s 4 year old. That we would also have so much fun was not known The whole environment is one of gala and celebrations. The different worlds created within Disneyland make for one new experience after the other. It is humanly impossible to do all the rides and there is a fair bit of walking in between the different    lands    and quite a wait for the very popular rides. You can you the fast access to plan though. The only downer was the food options. If you are fussy you should plan your movement through Disneyland to be around the restaurant that serves food that you like. The dining options are a bit pricey for the fare offered but that   s come to be expected of all entertainment parks et al. The rides themselves are brilliant. My wife is particular got nostalgic when she did the small world ride again after 15 odd years. The Iron man ride is a do not miss ride. Couple of pieces of advise:A. Plan your route. For eg. come to the Iron man ride in the evening. Nearly no waiting around that time. Plan where you want to have lunch and decide the route for covering the various lands.B. Plan which rides and attractions you want to cover or are must do. C. Get hold of the maps once you enter and the show timings. There are different shows and the timings vary. Also the popular ones go full sometimes 30 mins in advance. D. And finally see the timing of the parades. There a few in the evening. The grand finale at the park closing time is not to be missed. It gets crowded there so try and get there to get a good path side place. Honestly it   s near impossible to cover the park in a single day. Even most good ones would take a day to cover even at a rapid pace. Two days would give you the ability to cover the park in a relaxed manner. Goes without saying a must do. ,Disneyland_HongKong

The park opens later than other Disney parks which worked out for us because we could actually sleep in on vacation. The park is small but absolutely lovely. I found that our only negative was some pushy guests at parade time. There were virtually no lines for most rides. Our hotel gave us fastpasses but we didn   t need a single one. Most rides were actually walk on with no wait at all. We did wait about 20 minutes for Dumbo, I think that   s it. I would have liked to have seen more offerings to meet the characters. Cast Members were friendly but not quite up to the usual Disney standard. Overall, wonderful but small park, easily done in a full day. ",Disneyland_HongKong

636822111,4,2018-11,United Kingdom,"We had a lovely full day at Disneyland Hong Kong.We have been to Paris, California and Florida parks and Hong Kong is tiny in comparison but it is a still a fun day if you are in the area.The castle is still there but is partly obscured by construction walls and a crane   it will soon be demolished for a new super castle in 2019 which is really exciting.The park is mostly bilingual with English and Cantonese (and Mandarin on occasions)   we would it hilarious when Mickey and friends spoke in Cantonese.Tips:Highlights of the park that you have to go on   Mystic Manor (a unique experience amongst disney parks with a fusion of ratatouille and haunted mansion rides), Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Train (a fusion of Exhibition Everest and Big Thunder Mountain and a launch coaster), and Hyperspace Mountain (HKDL version of space mountain). We went on each of these twice and loved them. The rest of the park rides are the same similar as the rest of the parks around the world.Mickey and the Wondrous Book is a really special show and I highly recommend you see it. Each performance was full and it wasn't until our third attempt did we get a seat! It's a fusion of Florida's happily ever after night time show and Paris's Peter Pan night time show. The live singing and performers were all excellent.Both parades were excellent and are your opportunity to see lots of characters at once. Arrive 30 minutes before to get your spot.If you want to meet characters get to the park for 9.30am. Gates open at 10 and there are lots of characters to meet on main street USA before the main park opens at 10.30   Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald and Daisy, Chip and Dale were all out and about.Only negatives of our day were the weak side show performances e.g. Moana home coming and the Christmas stage show. I'd avoid these and use the time to go on rides. Also the shops were always rammed and overflowing with queues snaking around the shop so you couldn't find the end of the line.

We didnt stand in a line for longer than 20 minutes. When the park opens you are first only allowed in the shopping area, obviously so you can buy stuff and they can make money but there is sooooo much to choose from.We went on most of the rides and went on them twice   once at day and once at night.We bought the tickets and food vouchers on Klook and this was a great savings and also really worth it.The rides were really fun and the overall ride experience was amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed the mine cart in the grizzly grouch area, as well as the star wars ride and the toy story horse shoe.The parades   we watched both the day and night parades   were absolutely spectacular and definitely worth going to   just a tip though is to find a spot about 30 minutes before the parade is due to start as there are alot of people.Also try and find a spot towards the end of main street USA where the road splits to the different parks as the last few floats and characters dont go all the way to the bottom of the road.We also managed to watch two of the shows. The Lion King which was amazing and then Moana which was great but the Lion King was definitely a way better experience.The only let down was that the characters are not walking around so they were only available for short time slots and for a limited amount of people so you had to try and plan your day around this.",Disneyland_HongKong

We visited the park during a weekday and even though there was a lot of people in the park, the queues for rides were very good, averaging around a 10 minute wait.The parade is not to be missed and was very well put together.

636209289,4,2018-11,Australia,"Entry was expensive, kids under 2.5 years free. A lot of people told us it wasn   t worth it and it will be crap however we did enjoy it. The kids are young so they rode on rides that suited their age group. Not a huge variety of food but there are a few restaurant cafes around. My only safety concern was lack of security guards or police presence. I caught a man taking pictures of my child along with other kids while watching the Moana live show. He was on his own not accompanied by a child or family. He was taking photos of young teenagers too. I confronted him to delete but he didn   t speak English. Managed to delete but this didn   t stop him doing it again. We spotted him a few times. While waiting for our turn on rides 2 other I saw two native people taking photos of my own children I asked them to stop and intervened but again people don   t speak English. They   d stare like it was completely normal and I   m over reacting. It made me very upset, angry and furious and this behaviour is unacceptable. Especially when it comes to children. When I contacted authorities and staff they didn   t seem to care. This is VERY VERY important that people are made aware and to be on alert. PLEASE WATCH YOUR KIDS AT ALL TIMES! don   t take your eyes off them. ",Disneyland_HongKong

We have received complimentary ice cream at restuarant and some staff would wish Happy Birthday.However, it is prob my last time gg to Disneyland HK as the 1) Lion King show was the same as 10 yrs ago. 2) experience of being pushed by rude mainland Chinese in queues was not pleasant at all.

However if you visited any other Disneyland like Shanghai or Tokyo you might not feel very happy with this disney land as i couldn't find any WOW factor in this Disney land.

Most of the rides in Small World are the same sans Peter Pan. Their rides in some of the areas are different. Food is really bad. Jr Yelper said we should eat at the best restaurant in the part, The Explorer Club with a variety of ethnic selections to order. But at nearly $20 a plate with meager portions, it was the worse Disney park meals I   ve ever had. The Jungle Ride was closed the weekday we went. They had 2 different Disney ice cream pops sold at the carts. One is blueberry and the Minnie is Strawberry for $5 USD. They were OK. The evening light show was basically flashing lights of Mickey and friends on the buildings. The electric parade was really good. We watched part of the Moana show. We were so bored and the singing was mediocre so we left. This is the 4th of the Disney parks we   ve been to and easily ranks at the bottom. ",Disneyland_HongKong

Download the App and it tells you the current wait times all over the park.It is much smaller than Disneylands but that was good for us with 2 kids under 7, it was easy to walk around the whole park a few times, and most of the rides were good for the younger kids. It might be lacking if you're after big thrills. The food was generally ok and not at astonishing prices.As it got dark we went back and had a second ride on all the things we wanted and some we had missed earlier in the day. All 3 parades we good and as it wasn't too busy everyone was able to see fine. Highlights: The Lion King show (don't miss this and it's a good airconditioned break), Mystic Manor and the Jungle River cruise (make sure you go after dark, it's much better). As people have mentioned HK Disneyland doesn't really have the characters just walking around the Park like you find in other Disneylands, so if getting pics with them is your thing you will have to line up at specific locations and times. The train out there was good, and wasn't even packed after closing time (we walked slowly back to the station). Easily managed to stay the whole day, opening to close, and would definitely go back next time we are in HK.

We visited in mid November and the park was decorated for Christmas which made it even more special. It was my wife and I and our 20 year old daughter who went. The rides were excellent. The lines were pretty short (we were there on a Monday), the longest we waited was 20 minutes but some rides we just walked on. The shows and parades were pretty good. Except the snow show at 6:15pm. Not worth waiting around for. The park was clean, the toilets were clean, plenty of food stores (overpriced but that goes with the territory)Best rides were Mystic Manor, Grizzly Gulch and the Iron Man one in Tomorrow Land. My daughter said the only negative was that there were no thrill rides like a major roller coaster. Getting there via the MTR was super easy. If you bought the tickets online you have to go to Guest Relations on the left of the main gate to pick up your actual tickets. If this has been helpful please give me a helpful vote.

Our experience at Hong Kong Disneyland was a memorable one.. having been to the parks in California, USA, we found Hong Kong to be much quieter and the longest we ever lined up for a ride would have been 10 15 minutes   and this was only for a couple of rides! We did stay at the nearby Disneyland Hotel, and this included some  priority passes  to certain attractions.The rides were all fun, with all but a couple having height restrictions that our 4 year old just missed out on! The only disappointment was the BIG lines to see the characters   and this resulted in us missing out on a photo with most of them! Even with a full 2 days here.. The lines close, well before they even officially arrive, and with only a couple of appearances each day, it is so limited! There should be more characters dressed up, and they should be out & about ALL day   not just an hour here & there... there could be 2 of each scattered throughout the park even.. and this would make everyones visit just that bit more magical!!

The rides were outdated and given HK love of all things electronic we expected more. There was a greater variety of rides in Paris. The parades started late   so we missed the last few minutes of the evening parade as we had a coach pick up to meet. The parades were not a patch on Paris some 25 years agoThe majority of the staff were rude and unhelpful   unlike the Paris staff.

633163763,4,2018-10,Hong Kong,Need to plan which rides you want to go on and what you want to see as it   s too big to do everything. shows arrive about 15 20min early. rides were max about 30min to 1 hour wait without fast track on a sunday. Hit the ones you want to go first early to beat the crowds. I went for halloween and there was a good 2 for 1 deal on disney   s site that allows me to enter the park a second time before the end of this year. For popular characters expect at least 30 min to 1 hour waits to take pictures with them (eg. jack and sally for halloween). disney staff give out lots of stickers and candy during halloween. the villains night parade at the end is not as exciting as the one during the day or their regular one as the floats with the villains are plain comparatively. ,Disneyland_HongKong

It   s magical right from the beginning with beautiful statues of Mickey Mouse and his friends in a big water fountain. We arrived in the morning as soon as the park was opening and went through the ticket queue fairly fast. But the crowd was growing much quicker than expected, and later on we found out we chose a public holiday weekend so the crowds were much bigger than usual! We would advise to research this before you plan your trip because it definitely tested our patience and dampened our spirits at times. Because of this, the queues for every single ride were anywhere from 30 minutes several hours long, and it was a very hot day. We anticipated having to line up at Disneyland but the public holiday really made things 10 times slower. But when your at Disneyland, not even that can get you down, it   s just so magical and happy! One ride in each    land    had the option for you to scan your ticket and it would give you another ticket with a time frame on it, so you   re able to go and do other things then come back to skip the line within that time frame. We were then able to go on all the main rides and explore each land. There were so many amazingly fun rides to experience, as well as photo meet and greets with favourite Disney characters such as Eeyore, r2d2, iron man and more. Tarzan   s treehouse is just brilliant, toy story land is every big kids dream and we were lucky enough to see Disneyland at Halloween time, which was spectacular! We spent all day there and upon reflection, would   ve planned to spend 2 full days, regardless of the public holiday. Disneyland truly is what you imagine it to be and more!

There were no closing fireworks, told that it had been discontinued. There are restaurants inside the park, however foods were expensive and average in taste. It is an expensive affair; entry tickets, inside food etc. all are overpriced. Though at the end it was tiring, but overall it was a fun filling day spent at HK Disney Land.",Disneyland_HongKong

631564893,4,2018-10,Malaysia,"Never having been to Disneyland before, I found it very entertaining. The space was huge and they had a very convenient luggage holding area for us to leave our luggage at HKD 110 per piece. A lot of walking involved, so was very glad we wore comfortable shoes and clothes. We bought discounted tickets via Klook and could get in with no problem. Once inside, we went to look at the rides and a lot of them were not thrill rides, but fun nonetheless. I was very impressed with the amount of detail that went into creating the rides and their upkeep. Everything is perfectly maintained and no chipping paint to be seen anywhere!Delicious food is nowhere to be found in Disneyland, though. So it's just eating to survive, and your tastebuds are not taken into consideration. We managed to take all the rides we wanted to, and still take in some shows before the park closed. In the evening, the lines were much longer, because HK residents came for the evening with their annual passes. It can rain anytime in HK, so pack a raincoat if you have it. Even if it doesn't rain, it will come in handy on the mine train ride. The parade at the end of the day was really cool! Since it was halloween season, all the Disney villains came out to play.",Disneyland_HongKong

However, the park was under renovation, so the sleeping beauty castle and the fireworks were not there. How I wish I could watch the fireworks in front of the castle!Note: the haunted house is small and boring, not worth waiting in a long long queue. The grey bear mine, the star wars track, iron man are my favorite. The star wars track has speed pass, which is worth fetching asap.Wifi is extremely slow. Don't rely on it!

Disneyland Hong Kong can at a push be done in a day. It is one of the smaller Disney global sites, however, what it lacks in size is made up for in atmosphere.

I came all the way from Indonesia, paying expensive airfares, and also paying expensively for a 2 night stay at your hotel. But during my visit there, several sections, such as Adventureland, Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Point, and Toy Story Land.To make matters worse, the closure was done during the prime time of the park, around 2 3 pm all the way to the dark around 6 pm, and in some cases even until Disney closed. I was very disappointed in this, and I would like to see some responsibilities from Disney regarding this issue. Disney should've given a certain reduction on the hotel price and or Day Pass price due to this  incomplete magical experience .",Disneyland_HongKong

630734380,5,2018-3,United States,"English language travel books and blogs like to compare Hong Kong Disneyland to Ocean Park Hong Kong. Opened in 1977, Ocean Park often gets the nod over its 13 year old rival with the more scenic location, being three times larger, having a wider range of attractions and thrill rides, and for entertaining guests with shows starring not costumed characters, but live land and marine animals. Two categories in which Ocean Park is all wet, however, are food     ho hum carnival type fare versus Disneyland   s higher quality, wider ranging dining experiences     and, the deciding factor for me, what is known as    Disney Magic.    There   s something different about being at a Disney park     the hospitality, memory making, cleanliness, positive attitude, and characters and stories beloved for generations. It   s like coming home whether you went as a child or not. HKD is the smallest of all Disney parks, but that doesn   t make a visit any less magical and unique. Its version of the Haunted Mansion is Mystic Manor, which whisks guests through the Victorian home of world traveler Lord Henry Mystic. The mansion comes alive after Henry   s mischievous pet monkey Albert opens a music box that unleashes mayhem and enchantment. Another HKD exclusive is the exciting year old Iron Man Experience; imagine Stark Enterprises assuming sponsorship of Star Tours. Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars, HKD   s version of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, has a section where riders go backwards. Just for fun, enter the    Cantonese    or    Mandarin    line at the Jungle Cruise to hear those tired, corny jokes in a different language. OK, so there   s no Matterhorn or Pirates of the Caribbean, but when was the last time you ate smoked duck legs and curry fish balls in Anaheim or Orlando?",Disneyland_HongKong

Between 10:30am and 2pm there are nearly NO queues at any entertainment   rides then it hits 2 3pm and the most popular rides have 30 50 mins waits. You CAN bring in water (I took in three bottles and showed them when entering and was let straight through) and a small amount of food, just don't bring a picnic. Sure the food is overpriced and substandard but this IS expected in theme parks.

My wife enjoyed the jungle ride and the cup and saucers as we always seen it on T.V.

We even discovered that the best time to go is in the pouring rain as no one else is there and there are no queues! If it suddenly brightens up it will be about 2 hours before the crowds return, that, my friends, is a very good tip. Nowadays we never go and stuff like that I avoid like the plague but if you've got young kids then you just have to take them, they will love it. Remember tho, it's crowded as all hell, expensive, you can't take your own food so you are forced to eat at the restaurants and even buy water and the queues are long.

I had reservations about Hong Kong Disney as I have been to the other Disney parks and this one is obviously much smaller than what I am used to in the context of the magic of Disney!However, whilst small, it   s perfectly formed and there is still huge variety of things to do across the park. I would say it   s particularly geared for smaller children as the size suits their ability to get around the park and do everything. Highlights were the Flights of Fantasy parade (magical), toy story land (in particular the parachute ride) and It   s a Small World (my all time favourite!). It   s everything you would expect from Disney in a really nice bite sized dose which makes it perfect for a 1 day visit. ",Disneyland_HongKong

629073732,5,2018-10,United States,"Reading online I felt there was a huge feeling of inferiority to this Disneyland compared to its American counterparts but I can honestly say I had a great time! It may look small on a map but I would say it felt about the same size as Disneyland California. There is so much to see and do our only downtime was sitting down to eat twice the whole day. I would say if you are a hardcore Disney fan it can be a two day park but you can definitely do it justice in one.My favourite rides (in order) were Mystic Manor, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Car, Hyperspace Mountain and The Iron Man Experiece**. We headed straight to The Iron Man Experience and Mystic Manor when we first got to the park and faced minimal wait time   When we returned later on in the day queues had built up but we stayed onsite at the Hollywood Hotel which provided us with Fast Passes which came in very handy in these instances.** Shout out to It   s A Small World and the Dumbo rides that hold a special place in my heart too**The shows at Hong Kong Disney were amazing too   Check out Festival of the Lion King, Mickey and the Wonderous Book and Mickeys PhilharMagic. I can   t remember enjoying shows at other Disney Parks as much. The We Love Mickey show was cool too and didn   t involve having to fight with crowds for a space down Main Street   the show is literally projected into the surrounding buildings so you can stand wherever you like. At the end of the day there was a Villains Night Out show keeping with the Halloween theme and involving popular villains from your favourite Disney movies. It was a lot of fun but mostly in Chinese so apart from a whole lot of cackling I wasn   t really too sure what was going on! (Shout out to Cruella who was giving it 100!!!)As well as the shows there were parades to see too. Mickeys Flight of Fancy was the best. Again, keeping with Halloween, there was a Halloween Street Party down Main Street which was fun but could have been avoided. The Hong Kong Disneyland app came in very useful when planning my day at Disney, providing show parade times and where they were located. As you can probably tell I am a Disney fan. I honestly had a great time and feel like people are a tad harsh in relation to this park (I was constant told not to expect too much). My only disappointments are:1) the size of Sleeping Beauty castle and the fact there was a lot of construction going on around it (   pardon our dust we are creating magic   ). As my partner pointed out the 15ft fence probably made the already small castle look even smaller but I am sure once they are finished it will look amazing and I will definitely be back to see for myself! 2) Despite the Disney Corporation priding themselves in magic and customer service I was a disappointed to not see this fully reflected in this park. Overall customer service was lacking in Hong Kong as a whole and I understand culturally it is a different world, but I was constantly disappointed in the rudeness I experienced during my trip and think it something that needs to be worked on at this park in order to keep in with the Disney magic.",Disneyland_HongKong

The MRT trip from downtown Kowloon is simple to say the least and took about 50 mins. The gates open at 10am for a wander and many photo opportunities with well loved characters, the    lands    open at 10.30am. The new Ironman experience was easy for a couple of grandparents and we thought the transformer ride at Universal Studios much more exciting. Young and old would love it....youths would find it tame. The staff are all friendly and extremely helpful and do their best to make it a happy place. We visited today, midweek and there were no lines for anything, whatever rude or experience you wanted you just wandered to it. There were 3 Main Street parades doe to being Halloween I think. They were good, quick and not crowded. The Lion King Show is a stand out, it was in 2013 and still is. The Star Wars ride is just the old Space Mountain ride with a new name. We enjoyed Toy Story land. As grandparents we enjoyed watching the expressions on the faces of children mostly aged between 3 to 6 they were in their element.

It is where Adults can be kids and kids to be thrilled by the magic. Firstly, if you are not staying in the Disney resort it is wise to buy your tickets online, also include your meal in the ticket as it is easier and cheaper. The package also includes a drink or ice cream AND a $50 voucher to spend at the Disney shop.We arrived close to opening time to beat the crowds but also remember the grand parade and fireworks are late evening, so check the show times and choose your arrival time accordingly. There is only one train connection in and out of Disneyland, don't stress about missing it as it runs every 10 mins etc. Entry during non peak season is quick, but beware bags are checked and no picnics, outside food or big drinks allowed.Once, inside the FUN begins, grab a map, review show times then run amok. If you are in a big family group like we were, separate and meet up when you  bump  into each other or at a arranged time as not every ride is suitable for everyone.The outer restaurants are quieter and are like food markets, make sure you take your voucher to validate if applicable.Queues for rides in October wasn't to long a wait between 5   25 mins, depends on type of ride as the more fast action rides went quicker as little kids could not go on them. The Dumbo ride was the best, simple BUT Fun. If you want the adrenalin rush then the Star Wars ride and the old Cabin Rail ride will do the trick. Skip the Halloween walk through journey, it's in Chinese with only one character speaking English. The  It's a Small World After All  ride in Fantasyland is so CUTE!Time flies and in no time the day ends as everyone is tired and themed park out.tyThanks to the Security staff who let our devastated 6 year old nephew re enter at the exit gate with his parents to search for his Disney cap he had left behind while posing for a photo just before exiting.

625303443,4,2018-10,India,"We took a 2 day ticket as we were not sure with one day it can all be covered. The first day, we reached by 10 AM and being a weekday it was not very crowded. Its Halloween time and the place had parades and decorations for Halloween. Started with start trek and iron man rides and it was good. Remember, these rides are not as thrilling as the Universal studio and intended for young children (this is Disney!) Then proceeded to the shows and realized that shows get full if you don't reach early. The Moana show had very little seating and the security staff especially one male was kind of rude to people who were walking around. I guess they need to remember that they are not police and kids come with a lot of hope to see this. Not all staff are very fluent in English and when they speak in English they sound rather rude. (Don't stand here, I DON'T know, Move away! etc are the words you hear). Some of them really need a lesson on being 'polite while being assertive'.The food options as written by many others are disappointing for people who do not eat pork and beef, there are very few chicken options. We tried the Asian cuisine restaurants and they are very average when it comes to quality of food. For vegetarians, it's a day of fasting!! (kidding, but it is almost true).If you book from Disney site, you get $15 x2 coupons. The main street store refused to take more than one coupon for a transaction, I argued and they called the manager who confirmed the rule!   one coupon per transaction. But to my surprise on the second day of my visit another store inside (star trek or the fantasy land one) accepted 2 coupons on my wife's ticket. Surprising. Again I think its English language proficiency that is the culprit. Unpleasant experience.The parades were excellent, especially the 8 PM Halloween parade. Shows were also really good and I guess more than rides these are the things you shouldn't miss while in Disneyland.The second day was a Saturday and we could clearly see the difference in the crowd. It was crowded from 10 AM itself. We had only a few stuff pending and finished everything by lunchtime. Overall, it was a 1 and a half day visit and in my opinion, if you are not so particular about missing out a couple of rides you can cover this park in 1 Day itself   try to visit on a weekday.  MTR is connected to the park and transportation to the city is very easy.   There was no free Wi FI  The HongKong Disneyland app on Android can give you details of the shows. It just keeps crashing often on my Samsung phone but for a day it's manageable.  No food or drink allowed to be carried inside, Its mentioned everywhere but I still saw people getting caught in the security and wasting time in disposing off.  Many rides and attractions can be closed for public on a certain day due to 'private' events, details are updated on daily basis on the website and app. Check beforehand and plan.  You should be going at least 20 mins early for the shows, they get filled up fast.",Disneyland_HongKong
625141875,5,2018-10,Australia,I have been to Disneyland in Los Angeles so I can only compare the Hong Kong site to the original. I enjoyed this Disneyland very much. The staff were always friendly and helpful. We had a mix up with our pre bought tickets and they went out of their way to help us resolve the issue even offering us express passes to some of the popular rides. Having been there in October they had a Halloween theme throughout the park and line ups to rides were not long as it was out of the holiday season for Hong Kong residents. They were giving away lots of stickers and lollies in the Halloween themed garden where kids could make up small baskets to go trick or treating. This was all free. Food is standard theme park menu items. We had burgers and fries which was decent enough.The theme park is near the airport direction and it cost us approx $50AUD each way from our hotel in Mong Kok via Uber (we had 6 people and needed a large van).There is also complimentary wi fi throughout the park.Its a long and tiring day when you are there from 10:30am until 8:30pm at night but it is worth it to see all the parades as well as the rides and features. I recommend to attend over two days as we didn't get to see all the themed sections in the first day. The kids loved it and so did us adults.,Disneyland_HongKong
625139064,4,2018-10,Philippines,Disneyland Hong Kong is small compared to other Disneyland we visited. When we visited it wasn't that clean. Leaves from the trees are scattered in the alley. The pavement construction was not sophisticated too. The pros is that you can roam the entire Disneyland in one day for it wasn't that big.,Disneyland_HongKong

625065180,3,2018-1,Singapore,"My first time at a Disneyland was rather disappointing; the queues were terribly long, the food was massively overpriced, and the rides were hardly thrilling. I supposed this park is catered mostly towards touristy families with young children, because there are much better things to do in Hong Kong and better cheaper theme parks such as Ocean Park. My advice is to go ahead to HK Disneyland if you are travelling with children or the elderly and have quite a bit of money to spare as it is a small theme park with expensive food and souvenirs but is extremely tourist friendly. If not, explore Hong Kong in its authenticity instead!",Disneyland_HongKong
624884437,2,2018-5,United States,The Disneyland here is way too commercialized   too many stores than rides compared to the ones in US!My brother did not enjoy it since the ultimate night show was cancelled & that was not announced in their website!It was a big disappointment for my supposed to be treat!,Disneyland_HongKong
624857744,4,2018-9,Australia,Compared to Disneyland In California this Park is smaller but in saying this it is still a memorable and enjoying experience. The only complaint we had was that it rained most of the day but it didn't detract from the great time we had,Disneyland_HongKong
624808403,5,2018-10,Australia,"By comparison to LA , this Disneyland is not so intimidating and bug. We spent 2 days and still did not see everything. The ride lines are not long, didn   t use our priority passes. The staff are friendly and with a 6 year old it was perfect. ",Disneyland_HongKong
624722169,4,2018-6,Indonesia,"I love Disney. I can say that I am Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse biggest fan. But I still can't get the idea of spending 2 3 days of your holidays in Disneyland. For that reason, I think the size of the area of HK Disneyland is perfect. It might be slightly smaller than other Disneylands, but for some people who does not want to spend their times in Disneyland (just like me), this place is great. I came to this place in June, when it was 32degrees celsius in HK. If I have to spend my whole day in Disneyland under the crazy sun of HK, I don't think I would make it. Lol. So it might be a good idea not to have a bigger area of Disneyland in 2 seasonal countries such as HK. Furthermore, you still can have all of the favourite rides and attractions. So, overall...i give it 4 stars. Highly recommended if you want to have Disneyland experience but unwilling to spend more than 1 day trip.",Disneyland_HongKong
624611488,4,2018-10,Thailand,"Best get in early as possible though, crowd & queueslow in the morning an as the day progresses obviously the queue time extends.I would start at Tomorrow Land and work your way around the park in a anti clockwise direction as I believe the rides are better and if you run out of time you haven't missed out on too much. Take something to eat in a back pack if with a young family as eating at the park is very expensive. All in all a great day with good family memories forever.",Disneyland_HongKong

My wife and I were a little disappointed getting pictures with Micky and Minnie was a task in its self, lines so so long no shade and kept getting closed off, so had to keep going back and start over again.wich made it a very long day.

624203838,5,2018-9,Singapore,"A day in Disneyland has always been magical. When me and my friends reached Sunny Bay Station to get to Disneyland Resort, we were greeted by a Disney themed train with Mickey shaped windows. Do bring along an umbrella or poncho just in case it rains and there is no shelter. Whether you are with a family of friends, you will enjoy the experience. Most rides cater to children but there are roller coasters and thrilling rides at Toy Story section. There is 2 halal certified store at Mainstreet Market and the Explorer's Club for muslim travellers. Do look out for the parades as kids will love it. Wear comfortable outfit and shoes if possible as the place is damn huge and require lots of walking. Highly recommended for all ages.",Disneyland_HongKong
624183786,2,2018-10,Australia,"When it comes to Disney, you expect wonderful things, but we were very disappointed with our overall experience here on our recent visit. The park is very small and doesn't have the magical vibe that Anaheim Disneyland exhibits. The majority of staff that we encountered had the personalities of bricks and showed no happiness or excitement. Food options were very average and opportunities for photos with characters were limited. With the park closing at approx 8:45pm on the day we visited, photos with Mickey and Minnie were closed off at 4pm, causing much disappointment from numerous visitors. The general upkeep of the park also seemed quite poor, with overgrown gardens and dirty grounds in some areas. While there was the advantage of much shorter queues for rides, this Disneyland just feels like another average theme park and doesn't even come close to comparing with the original in Anaheim. I wouldn't recommend visiting this theme park. ",Disneyland_HongKong
624135894,3,2018-9,United Arab Emirates,Visiting Disneyland is dream for Kids & adults as well. We visited earlier in Paris but first time for my boy. The Disney train is really really lovely. Unfortunately during our visit the Main castle was closed for renovation & many other rides were closed due to Typhoon hence had limited choice. Even in evening the fireworks was cancelled & replaced with Parade which was good.Too small compare to the one in Paris with two attractions Disney Park & Studio but still good.Suggest to book ticket in advance preferable online at discounted price.,Disneyland_HongKong

Nice touch!Park   not the biggest of a Disney parks, one main ride per area plus some smaller ones. The castle is quite small (and at Oct 18 was undergoing maintenance and boarded up which was a shame). Some rides we hadn   t been on at other Disney parks.   The haunted mansion was actually quite good.   Iron Man the screen was blurred so didn   t rate it.   very clean and good staff  guests are all polite and everyone queues...I only mention this as this is not the same in eurodisney!",Disneyland_HongKong

Better not to choose October or Chinese New Year as it will be crowded to serve the huge Chinese visitors.",Disneyland_HongKong
623581485,4,2018-9,United Kingdom,All you would expect from a Disney site. The queues were short on the day which meant that we saw  rode most attractions in one day.

623356811,5,2018-9,Australia,"We took our 1 year old to visit Hong Kong Disneyland as a birthday treat. We went the day after the clean up from the typhoon   I was very impressed with their efficiency! We had a fabulous time. The baby had fun on  it's a small world after all  boat ride, the  Winnie the Pooh  train ride and the  Incredibles  ride. It was easy to get around with a stroller (compared to the rest of HK which isn't stroller friendly), had decent food options for babies at the cafe, decent baby change and breastfeeding facilities were available and the staff were very friendly. We enjoyed the fact that it wasn't as large as the other Disneylands so it was easier to see all the entertainment. As we were leaving for the night, they put on a special Halloween parade. It is easy to get to HK Disneyland via the metro but you do need to change at least once on the metro if your hotel is on another HK island e.g. Kowloon. It is also close to the cable car ride at Ngong Ping so if there is time and energy, I would recommend doing the two together on the day. See Ngong Ping first and take the cable car for a great view of the beauty of HK and then take the metro to Disneyland and enjoy the rest of the day and evening there.",Disneyland_HongKong
623339896,5,2018-9,South Korea,"Smaller than the original Disneyland in Anaheim, but even with its compact nature it packs a day full of fun. We got super lucky on our day, it wasn   t so crowded so my friends and I managed to do every single thing, except the little kids rides. There are a few unique rides and HKD, like mystic manor and the new iron man ride, which will give you bragging rights as they aren   t at other parks, but then standards like a Star Wars version of space mountain, it   s a small world, and my personal favorite the jungle cruise. As to shows, go see them all. They were so much fun and amazing. Even some shows are in multiple languages at once, it only adds to the charm. Lion King was my favorite. And the parades, especially the Villains parade at night was really fantastic. The food was also good and not unreasonable considering HK prices. And if you want special stickers be sure to ask cat members for help or questions and then you may get one. I got three. Over all amazing fun day. ",Disneyland_HongKong
623192942,4,2018-9,Canada,"While not nearly as robust as it   s Japanese, French and American counterparts, Hong Kong Disneyland has its charms. The number one perk: the crowds. I have never seen crowds so light at a Disney park. Nearly all rides were walk on the entire day     even the fantastic Mystic Manor, Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Minecars and Hyperspace Mountain. The downside to the low crowds: many rides, shops and food vendors all had off hours (with some of the latter not opening at all). But the food we did have was great, the people were friendly and it was actually kind of nice not to have to rush through the relatively small park. Worth a one day visit for the casual Disney park fan; two days only for the fanatics. (Bonus tip: check out Mickey and the Wondrous Book, a fun and impressively produced musical stage show.)",Disneyland_HongKong

623063730,5,2018-9,Australia,"Just like any other wonderful and enchanting Disneyland parks, facilities perfectly kept, high quality service and entertainment, we visit a week after one of the biggest typhoon ever hit the area, and besides the amount of trees they lost or got damaged everything else was up and running, with the exception of some areas around the castle that was close for repairs or improvements. Food was great, very large serves, food vouchers with our entrance tickets were a good option and even if you choose a meal over the limit of the voucher value, you can paid the difference. The park itself might be smaller than most of the other parks around the world, but still you have all of the favorite rides and areas, we loved every minute of it. One of the highlights for us, was the amazing Lion King show. Lots of characters around the park, 4 great parades every day. Great family experience. ",Disneyland_HongKong
622786289,4,2018-10,Australia,We loved the experience and thought the rides were excellent. We stayed at Hotel Disneyland which I would highly recommend.Try to come in winter as the heat was almost unbearable during the middle of the day especially with 45 min queues due to Golden Week. It would be wonderful to see the park open until 10 or 11pm so that the rides could be enjoyed outside of the heat. We didn   t want to leave at 8pm!,Disneyland_HongKong

When we went to Disneyland on the Sunday before the Festival we didn't realise that the line to get into the park would be over an hour long at 10am. The heat was oppressive and there was far too little shade and water dispensers available. After waiting, waiting and waiting we gave up by 3pm (after only getting in at 11am!) and left.The park is very small compared to other Disneyland's but the crowds at the bag check at the entrance were like I have never, ever seen before. Crazy!",Disneyland_HongKong
622768816,5,2018-10,New Zealand,"Hong Kong Disneyland was the third Disney experience for my fianc  e and me after LA and Paris.It   s smaller than the other Disneylands, and could probably be done in one day, but we opted to pay the tiny bit more for a second day, and ended up very pleased with that decision as we felt we got a lot of payback out of doing rides multiple times. Hong Kong Disneyland seem really good at making the rides effective even if you   ve done them a lot before. Mystic Manor is probably the best example, the details and special effects are incredible, we were noticing new things the fifth time we did it.The Jungle Cruise is also great   we did it four times   with the guides genuinely funny and a great action packed circuit. One of the zebras was missing an ear though.It is the least impressive Space Mountain we have seen yet but still worth doing a few times. The cheap Star Wars overlay does not work, and you can see too much of the track and rigging inside   it really should be blacked out, I thought that was the point.We highly recommend the Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine cars, we really like it how they did it in their own style rather than just mimic Big Thunder Mountain.Generally the crowds are well behaved with very little queue jumping.We were there on a Thursday and Friday   the park got really busy in the afternoon so I would recommend doing the big attractions in the morning or at the end   in the last hour we were able to walk on to It   s a small world, Jungle cruise, and Grizzly Mine carts without any queue.I would also suggest doing Fantasyland as soon as the park opens   we did five rides in the first hour, which would have been impossible later in the day.The teacups here are the fastest we have experienced and the rides are overall fairly gentle on the head and neck but still a lot of fun. We didn   t really like the Disneyland Railroad (not much to see   this seems pointless outside of LA) and the Iron Man simulator, which looked suspiciously similar to Star Tours.Throughout Disneyland, the cast are not as exuberant as in LA and generally don   t add to the experience, apart from on the Jungle Cruise. But they are helpful and polite and most seem to speak enough English for us to not have to worry. The only time where our our experience was marred by our lack of any Chinese language was the seasonal walkthrough based on the Nightmare before Christmas. There were 5 or 6 sections, all but one were entirely delivered by characters speaking Chinese only, so we were not really able to follow it. Visually it was very impressive but they should have warned guests that they would not understand it if they didn   t speak Chinese because this was the only thing in the park not with no English and it had one of the biggest wait times.I would recommend that Disney seriously considers restricting people from using big sun umbrellas. The Fairy Tale Forest was pointless because people just stand with their umbrellas blocking everyone   s view.Overall the park is probably not as aesthetically impressive as LA or Paris but it still feels very Disney. One area where they excel is how they light up the park at night   it looks great.So going in we though it might not have the genuine Disney feel due to it being very small, but this turned out to not be a problem at all. We also noticed far less annoying stroller parking everywhere than in LA and far less smoking than in France. The food had very good Disney theming. We got our Disney fix and we would recommend it.",Disneyland_HongKong

Both my dad and I had the laksa which was at high quality ! My kids were having the hainan chicken , they enjoyed it a lot ! We got the pass to get into the Halloween town which was quite fun! Again may be too scary for young kids as my son cried after visiting The fantasy land is very suitable for young kids .

In the last few years, we have checked out LA and Paris versions together. The park was great, alot better than expected and a nice size, meaning you could get around all the attractions if you spent the whole day there. The rides were longer than some of the other parks we have visited recently. Our only drawback, came from the shows on offer. The Lion King show was a spectacle to watch, with it being all singing and dancing, however, the songs didn   t sound the same, with varying notes used by the performers. We also went to the Moana show, expecting to see and hear some of the great music, but this time there was no music at all involved. Maybe it is hard to find performers at the right ability, but it is a slight area of improvement, if I was being picky. Overall, it was a great day out and I would highly recommend it, Tip   It   s obviously very hot, so make sure you take lots of water with you, as it   s fairly expensive in the park. Tip   We went on a Tuesday, hoping it would be quiet but was very busy, possibly as it was the day after China Day, so try go on a slower day to get around everything. ",Disneyland_HongKong

621719662,5,2018-9,India,"Luckily i had kept Disneyland stay for the end of my family trip. The moment one enters the sprawling premises, one realises that only an American venture can be so elaborate, high tech & beautiful. With nothing much to do for a family visiting Hong Kong (in terms of activities involving kids), Disneyland more than made up for it. Built like a fairy  fantasy land with separate sections, one ideally needs 2 full days to be able to enjoy everything. Crowded like mad, there are long queues even for getting snaps clicked with disney characters all over. The 3 parades in a day were a spectacle to watch esp the end of the day as it was Halloween Theme in place. However, my son was hugely disappointed as he totally missed out on doing  Adventure Land  & still regrets it. Fault wasnt ours as we spaced out everything well after finding out shut down time from staff  site who told us it was 2000h. however, when we reached Adventure Land at about 1915h with 45mins to spare, it had totally shut down & nobody could explain as to why as all other sections were still open. Also, we had lost about an hour in the morning view heavy rains. But the authorities wouldnt allow us even limited entry of an hour into the Adventure Land the next day. that i personally feel was highly unprofessional & insensitive as THEY had shut down the section way before closing time. My son still feels miserable when he talks about the trip. So ideally, stay inside for 2 nights   just the right amount of stay. Its worth every penny",Disneyland_HongKong

Food was pretty pricey but was delicious. Was great seeing the halloween theme throughout the park and incorporated into their food design too.

I was running and lowkey screaming when we got to the entrance arch. HAHA. A whole day is required to enjoy all the rides. We went there a little over lunch and we missed some. Lines were already forgiving during our trip since we went there on a Saturday in September, not a popular time to visit since blogs say it's already starting to rain in HK during September. Luckily, it was sunny during that time. And we only waited in line for an average of 10 minutes, I guess. Lucky, right?? Food will cost you a lot so it's better to eat outside and come with a full stomach. But if it cannot be avoided, there are food stalls inside. The sausages at Toy Story Land were good. !!!!DO NOT MISS THE HYPERSPACE MOUNTAIN RIDE AT TOMORROWLAND!!!! SO INTENSE!!!! The Small World ride was very cute and chill and relaxing, you should try that too. Since January 2018, there were no more fireworks display to close the day. To compensate, they do character parades three times a day. Because of this, we were not able to take photos with the characters (we prioritized the rides hehe) since no longer entertain photo ops at 5 PM, because the staff will be getting ready for the closing parade.

621228157,4,2018-9,South Africa,We felt like kids! First experience at a Disney. It truly is magical. Everything is themed! From the toys to the food! Was disappointed about the castle still being under renovation. Also take note of the times to get your picture taken with the various characters around the park. We were too late to get our Mickey and Minnie picture. The food voucher was well worth it. Food portion was large. Drinks are expensive but you must stay well hydrated for the amount of walking that is done. We did not use the fast pass as the park was not very busy. The shops are amazing and have the cutest items to purchase. Had to control ourselves! The parade at night was so much fun.

It ended so randomly after 5 walk throughs and majority in cantonese only (4 out of 5) On top of all we hardly queued at all the rides and waited the longest to go to this! 45 minutes. Whoever came up with the walk through story needs to sort out the    ending    of it. The actors tress were great though especially Sally the Rag Doll (shes really amazing from her make up to her voice) Jack was of course good and the themed rooms and decoration. But really got to pay attention from the start to end! Ending really impacts the guests impression too and our whole group of 12 15? were like wtf at the end.

They don't have a good pin selection here  just stickers? Not impressed since we traditionally get pins from Disney world every time we go. Customer service is not Disney level. People avoided eye contact, only approached us at the dining cafe when we we're signaling for help, and some cast members were on their cell phones! We we're trying to buy storm trooper magnets and we had to wait for someone to look up from their phone and ring us up. The roller coasters are fun and there were no lines it being a Wednesday. Super clean bathrooms and park. Toy story land is small but the rides are good for kids. They decorated for Halloween so it was enjoyable to see. Due the damages from the typhoon, the jungle cruise was closed  no biggie but I probably won't want to come back specifically for that ride. Thank goodness for the good company I was with.

Who would have thought there would be a train with Mickey Mouse head shaped windows? Cool!It   s a reasonable walk from the terminal to the actual entrance, but lots of things to look at (including of course lots of options to take your money!).The actual Park itself is very good. The various    lands    clean and slick, though staff in many are pretty slow to make things happen. Rides including roller coasters are fun and there is plenty for every age or level of    adventure    tolerance. Integration of Star Wars and Marvel themes are good, as is Toy Story Park area and Grizzly Gulch. Have to say that after a day I was theme parked out, but I can see that people that love Disney or theme parks could get far more out of it than me and over a couple of days. Certainly worth visiting if in Honk Kong. ",Disneyland_HongKong

All shows were good but personally i enjoyed watching festival of the lion king   musical stage show re telling the story of Simba (Hakunama Tata). Waiting time for each ride is around 10 15 minutes (weekends). See if there is a FASTPASS distribution sign near the entrance of the attraction you want to ride. Cartoon characters too have resting time therefore, there's a possibility of missing out on few. Night parade is Spectacular.Quick Tip: At the time of heavy rain you may visit the nearest Disney shop and buy a raincoat worth HKD 60. Available for both adult and child and walk freely in Disneyland",Disneyland_HongKong
620201737,4,2018-9,Taiwan,Hong Kong Disneyland is amazing. We took the MTR from Kowloon to HK Disneyland and the trains are adorable. The Mickey Mouse windows and then the various statues of Disney characters were so fun to see. We arrived before the park opened and got to watch a family open the park. This family the mom was cutely dressed and the kids were in different Halloween costumes and they were picked to open up Disney. It was SO adorable. Right now Disneyland is decorated all for Halloween and there is an area for the Villians to be out and planning. The music is a variety of Halloween music. Mickey and Minnie mouse were dressed for Halloween. Here is my opinion....HK Disneyland is a great place to go. If you want to go on the rides as long as you are going during a peak time (which I'm not sure when that would be    we went during the Moon Festival) but for most rides we waited no more than 20 minutes. However meeting the characters could ranges from waiting for 5 minutes or you could be waiting for over an 1 hour. Food    if you are okay with not air conditioner you could grab your food and eat outside on the tables outside the restaurant.,Disneyland_HongKong

The waiting time for rides are shorter than expected, probably because it was a weekday (but public holiday) and not during summer holidays.

And then we used our express pass given complimentary by Disneyland Hotel for all the fun rides and attractions, highly recommend space mountain because anything that is airconditioned and fast never fails to disappoint. After we've finished our priority passes we bought some slushies and popcorns to snack on and walked around to take polaroids with the characters around.

Didn't see any other characters walking around except for the Halloween characters and Mickey once they started playing the Mickey song in the street.

619461372,4,2018-7,United States,"This may be the most beautiful of the Disneylands I've visited (LA, Orlando, Shanghai and Hong Kong) but it has the least to offer of them. We stayed and I recommend staying in the Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel and were given paper FASTPASSes we could use on Ironman Experience, Hyperspace Mountain, Mystic Manor, Grizzly Gulch roller coaster, and Mickey's PhilharMagic (which we didn't see as we have seen it numerous times in WDW). You get a certain number of FP for each person per night you stay based on your level of room. We stayed in a Kingdom Club Room and received 4 passes per night per person so we had 16 passes as we stayed four nights for 5 attractions. I threw some away and gave some away because it was simply too many for such a small park to even want to ride those same five attractions that many times! But I highly recommend this for at least one night. Staying in the Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel also gets you into Mickey and the Wondrous Book's first show in first which we did. We were still able to get a FASTPASS for Winnie the Pooh in the park as well and used a VIP tour to do all the rest of the rides skipping the line and for a private viewing area of the nighttime parade (which we didn't need as it wasn't crowded compared to US park standards even in July and we watched the parade from the upstairs of the RR station on Main Street with no one around us and a superb view). We were able to ride things multiples times and see all shows we don't have in our American parks. We had a great time but there is far less to do here and it does not require more than a day if you plan correctly. They don't have a lot of newer amazing attractions like Shanghai did and it was extremely hot in July so I'm only giving it four stars.",Disneyland_HongKong

They recovered from the typhoon rather quickly. Most everything was open and you would never know the typhoon passed through here. The Ironman Experience is cheesy. It was just a photo opportunity with person in Ironman costume who used pre recorded voice. The Moana: A Homecoming Celebration is outdoors in a half covered venue. Also cheesy, but the kids seemed to like it. The Moana character sorta looked like Moana. The ladies might want to watch the movie again to do hula correctly. It was funny to see one of the drummers with a body suit to make him look tanned with Maori tattoos.The parade had the normal characters Toy Story, Lilo & Stitch, etc. Seemed shorter than the American version.Overall, this little Disney is entertaining for the children and maybe teenagers.

The cast are attentive and in character, the facilities are world class and the rides continually met Disney   s high standards. Our kids always love it, and as they get older, find new aspects of the park to love. Grisly gulch and mystic manor have climbed to the TOP of their list as favourite rides, and Groot is the new favourite character.

But for a Disney fans like me who have been to almost all Disneylands in the world except the one in Paris and Shanghai, I think the HK Disneyland is small but good enough for many people who have never been to Disneyland. One of the good things about the HK Disneyland is that you don   t have to walk a long way to get to each attraction as the park is not big. Compared to those in other cities such as the Disneyworld in Florida, for a slow walker like me, it   s pretty tiring to walk to each attraction, though there are some means of transport that I could use, for example the bus.And because it   s small, visitors can easily explore the whole park in just one day, giving them more time to see other beautiful places in HK.And for those visitors who like Chinese food, don   t forget to try the Plaza Inn, delicious chicken and suckling pig.

I could say that one day is not enough to try all the rides and attractions that this park has. But the best part for me are the shows we watched   Feast of the Lion King, Mickey's Philharmonic Theater and Storybook. It was like going back to my childhood days. So nostalgic, specially for a Disney fan like me. The parade was the main highlight for me which I totally enjoyed. One of the things I was disappointed about is that there were no fireworks because Sleeping Beauty castle was closed for renovation.

The park was closed during our stay for one day and many things in the park were not running or closed. All we asked was to be able to use our passes on Saturday to make up for the closed day and the other problems as we leave Sunday.He gave us the magical template answer with a NO, passes cant be used on Saturday with no consideration.

Kids had hotdogs which did not seem fresh. The 1.30pm parade was fantastic and a must see for all ages. ,Disneyland_HongKong

The hotel itself provides plenty of activities for children. One example is Tai Chi exercise with Master Goofy! Recommended to stay at least 2 days, 1 night to fully enjoy hotel amenities and also Disneyland park. Little Disney Princess Themed Package is a must for your little ones.

616087555,4,2018-8,United States,"Quintessential Disney. We were unsure of what to expect, but being Disney, how bad could it be? We have been to Orlando many many times and its been done to death. This park is much smaller and rides are similar, maybe with a different name, but similar to whats in Orlando. One big difference was Toy Story land, which reminded me of Hollywood Studios. These rides we hadn't seen before and they were super fun, even for an 11 and 13 year old. The lines in August were what you'd expect, most 45 minutes  if not more. We stayed at Disney property and were given what was basically fast passes for some of the rides. All of the rides didn't accept this pass, but the ones that did, we just went on the same 5 rides or so twice.",Disneyland_HongKong

615139075,1,2018-8,United Kingdom,"Hugely expensive (  126.40 for one adult and one 14yo.) for what surely must be the smallest of Disney's park offerings. If you expect western style junk food, think again, this was worse. The rides were good. Queue discipline was at times bad with ignorant people shoving their kids past us and when their kids cried out that the adults couldn't get by to join them, we reluctantly let them through too. The fairytale castle, tiny as it is was behind hoardings as I guess they were working to add extra magic with the diggers that were there. Go to Ocean Park instead.",Disneyland_HongKong
615022892,4,2018-3,Australia,"We went with our 2 year old and found HK Disneyland was great. We wished that we had booked a night at their hotel (despite it costing more than our hotel back in Sai Yin Pun). It would have meant that we could spend more time at Disneyland and get to stay for the fireworks at night. We went on a relatively quiet day, but the lines were still too long to bother getting photos with the characters that made random appearances throughout the day. Lines were good for the rides that were age appropriate for our 2 year old and we still managed to spend the whole day there, but not see everything. If we had another opportunity to go back, we would invest the few extra dollars to stay at the Disneyland hotel and therefore spend more time there. Cost is to be expected going to a theme park, and they had a lot of Chinese food available for lunch. Either that or expensive Mickey Mouse shaped waffles. The train that takes you to Disneyland from Sunny Bay was Disney themed and pretty cool. We actually went several years ago, not in March 2018, but was worth the belated review.",Disneyland_HongKong

We had a great time here, from the minute we got on the Disney Train, all the way till we left. It was really hot, and there is not much shelter, so you'll have to find respite in rides and shops. There are not that many rides here, and it's probably something you can do in 1 2 days at a leisurely pace, especially if it's not busy (there weren't any rides that had longer than 15 minutes wait when we went on a weekday).There are some unique features of this park  Mystic Manor, and some characters who we have never met before, like Cookie (friend of Duffy). Lilo is also here.The food here is expensive, and there is less variety than the US. No dedicated ice cream store, only one churro cart, etc..With little crowds, this was quite a good experience for us. The castle is small, but they're upgrading. Transport from the city is easy, and surprisingly quick, even when we left with all the others after the Paint the Night Parade.",Disneyland_HongKong
614892974,4,2018-7,Saudi Arabia,A nice place to visit with the family especially if they are early teens or younger. We got a very good deal through Air Asia with 20% off which made it even better. It is better to buy the meal deal from the site as that is economical compared to buying it individually provided of course if you are going to use for both lunch and dinner. Only issue is if it rains or signs of inclement weather then a lot of rides are stopped which could spoil your day and crowding at all indoor rides,Disneyland_HongKong
614741477,5,2018-4,Singapore,A good place for adult and children. Had a good fun time roaming around Disneyland and taking rides. To my muslim friends.... there is a halal foodcourt in the theme park. I advise to buy your tickets online and they might have a good  promotion.,Disneyland_HongKong

612301758,3,2018-8,United Kingdom,"As part of our trip to Hong Kong, Disneyland was definitely a must do. Having visited other Disneyland   s in the past, this one full filled some of our expectations, but not all.The arrival was easy, as well as entertaining. With special Disney MTR trains, a manicured Station, a grand sign leading up to the park, and a fountain with Mickey surfing above Moby Dick with all his friends watching.We walked straight to the gate queues having bought our tickets (from Klook) and printed them of as instructed. Unfortunately not everyone had done so, and there was chaos as people tried to find get their QR codes to work from their phones as they held up the every increasing line. The park opened at 10am, but no rides were open until 10.30. Even then not all. Sleeping Beauty   s Castle is under refurbishment, so can   t be seen properly or accessed. We rode and enjoyed The Iron Man experience which was a simulation ride, after getting fast passes for Space Mountain. The Jungle Cruise was ok, with queues for the 3 different languages. Don   t be fooled by the short English queue. After riding Space Mountain, we watched the Jedi Training. They catered well again for the different languages using them all. The kids were great.Unfortunately after that the heavens opened, and it poured with rain. There didn   t appear to be enough places for people to shelter, in regards to indoor rides or covered areas. Big puddles everywhere. However the silver lining was they did open Mystic Manor which was closed for the day.Overall not loads of rides, but lots of character meeting areas (with queues of course). Need to be a bit more organised?",Disneyland_HongKong
612212885,3,2018-8,India,"The rides are great as Disney   s quality and It is not too crowded so there is no long wait time. However, cast members are below par.

611506887,4,2017-11,India,"This theme park suits the kids very well. However, I was clueless as to why this park had a 2 days pass that sells. It can be completed well within 1 day as I feel that unless you will feel obligated to visit each n every attraction, there is no need to spend 2 days here. Otherwise, the place is beautiful, food is great, costly of course. The 4D effect in theatre experience of Iron Man was well created. But the post sunset fireworks were an absolute visual delight and you need to stay back till 7:30 pm to make your visit feel complete. Easy to commute to Disneyland by MTR: East Tsim Sha Tsui         Nam Cheong         Sunny Bay         Disneyland.

611414876,4,2017-10,Hong Kong,"I am barely qualified to gauge the quality of this or any other Disneyland: I don't have kids, and have not been to a Disney theme park since the 1980s. But Ladyfriend and I decided not long after we moved here to spend the weekend on Lantau, and so here we are. And to be frank, I enjoyed HK Disneyland. It's really small, as I am sure other reviewers have mentioned, which means that it's doable in two or three hours (maybe longer if you have kids?), and although it is missing (m)any of the thrill rides that other Disney properties feature (you'll have to go to Ocean Park for that...), it's a nice way to spend an afternoon.I'm not going to explain what Disneyland is. But I do have some tips.   Go on a weekday. I have never been on a weekend, but am sure it gets crowded. We didn't hit a single line on a Tuesday  They don't start serving booze until early evening. I don't know what my advice is on this front other than maybe  go later,  but I will say a propos of nothing that there is very little stopping one from hitting the 7 11 beforehand and bringing some roadies.  Lunch options are few, so same as above, although once you're in it's definitely not as expensive as other Disney parks in terms of food. There's a multinational, cafeteria style restaurant that is not great, but certainly gets the job done is doesn't break the bank.Note: I shouldn't have to even write this, but if you are visiting HK and looking for an  authentic  HK experience, do NOT go to Disneyland. Stick to the main island and to Kowloon, where there are a million awesome things to do and see. But if you have kids, or like rides, or need to check this Disney experience off of your bucket list, or have some sort of personal Disney thing such that you are all but mandated by your therapist or something to spend as much time as possible in the happiest place on earth, I won't try to dissuade you. Again, it's small enough that you can spend the morning doing actual HK stuff, and then spend the afternoon here, or vice versa. It's also pretty close to the action; if you're taking public, expect about a 90 minute ride from Central, but the nice thing is that Disneyland has a dedicated MTR line, complete with Mickey's head shaped windows and straps.Finally, here are the rides you want to go on, at least as an adult, as agreed upon by Ladyfriend and myself:1. Hyperspace Mountain (a very small scale Star Wars themed ride that piggy backs on the Space Mountain concept). It's less scary than an actual roller coaster, but there are some stomach drops. If I were big brothering a kid who was very frightened of roller coasters, I would make him go on this to build his confidence. There are a couple of cool SW tie ins as well.2. Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. It's all there in the name, and it's a fun little ride.3. RC Racer. This is their version of the big, swinging pirate ship ride that many of us grew up with. Stomach drops galore.4. Toy Soldier Parachute Drop. Your bench seat is hoisted way up high (affording one of the best views all day), and then... you drop. 5. Iron Man Experience. This is a VR experience that is several notches above seeing an action film in 4DX. It's OK for adults, but I suspect elementary aged kids would love it.",Disneyland_HongKong

Best Things:1. Rides and attractions are great, as are shows like Lion King. 2. Everything is clean and well maintained.3. Its so easy to get to and from with the MTR (train) or taxisWorst Things:1. Food is very expensive and wait times can be very long (eg 30  minutes for McDonalds!) for pretty basic fare. 2. Wait times for photos with Disney characters are very long, some active 'people management' should be employed to make it 15 seconds per photo opportunity then move on! 3.

It's good for 2 persons I guess. But we ordered one each. So we did not finish it. The rides are just very... cute. Really for kids. No life threatening rides which some people enjoy. But all in all, it's a great stay. Even the hotel did not disappoint. They sell Disney merchandise which are great souvenirs.",Disneyland_HongKong
609356988,5,2018-8,United States,I went to HK Disneyland from Wanchai on a rainy Friday afternoon. It was easy to get to on the MTR. The park was not too crowded and lines were fairly short. For some reason the Jungle Cruise line was longer than any other I waited for! Lucky for me they had a line for English speaking and the    river guide    spoke in clear English. Which is more than could be said for the train conductor whose English was indistinguishable from her Chinese. The castle was under construction but I was informed of that before I paid. I had a wonderful afternoon and four hours was plenty. ,Disneyland_HongKong
609062554,3,2017-9,United States,"This Disneyland is the smallest one compare with all others over the different parts of the world. However, it's amazing for Hong Kong, such a small place, to has a Disneyland. It's fun if you have not been any other Disneyland before. Don't expect too much and don't try to compare this one with others over different side of the world. I may say all the Disneyland theme parks are about the same, just different sizes and one have more rides than the other.",Disneyland_HongKong

608155012,5,2017-10,Israel,Been in Hong kong Disneyland twice. It is a smaller version of the Eurododney and the original Disneyland in the US.The Hong kong Disneyland specializes in shows which is a fantastic add on to the park usual stuff. I found this place very enjoyable and much better for the parents because you can catch up almost everything in less than a day. Very recommend!!,Disneyland_HongKong
607862846,5,2017-9,Australia,By far the smallest Disney. Easy enough to get most done in 1 day. Went during week so not so many kids. Has all the classic Disney features but on a smaller scale.,Disneyland_HongKong
607732296,4,2018-4,Sweden,"Travelled earlier this year in April.Very smooth getting to Hong Kong Disney by the MTR. Traveling with 3 young kids was fairly easy and smooth.Having visited most of the Disney parks we had quite high expectations for this park, and they were met. As soon as you board the Disney train from sunny bay station you can see and feel that there was no expenses spared. We visited on a Saturday and it was busy but not overcrowded.At the time not all the rides open and there were a few parts under construction or renovation including the main castle.Average wait time for the characters was about 1hr. Average queue time for kids rides was about 30mins.We opted for the 3 in 1 meal pass which worked out best for us.Our lunch meal was at royal banquet hall which was surprisingly very good, considering it was theme park food. And dinner was at Clopin's Festival of Foods, and this was amazing! Coming from Stockholm, I have to admit that the food we got from this restaurant was better than anything I   ve had in sweden. (Please check pics)Whether you visit Hong Kong disney with kids or not it is worth a visit! Who doesn   t like a day at a theme park? ",Disneyland_HongKong

Fun Characters. Dont let the rain put you off.The toy shops are wow Even adults were buying stuff lol.Only downside is no muslim prayer room but there is 1 stand near the entrance selling halaal food.Try the caramel popcorn. Too tasty and the smell is divine.,Disneyland_HongKong
606844266,5,2018-7,United States,"Definitely the smallest of all the Disney theme parks world wide, but it stores a really strong punch of Disney Magic! I visited during the 13th anniversary of the theme park. They are going through major renovations in 2018 and are slated to build a brand new castle! Perhaps by 2021 it will be completed! I've been to all the Disney theme parks and I must say this definitely takes the Chinese culture and melds it in with the traditional Disney experience. They offer grilled squid as a snack! Toy Story Land is a definitely Must See... YOU MUST go on the Mystic Manor ride! It's so much fun and offers a different vision of the Haunted Mansion ride! Another ride you must do is the Iron Man Experience which is similar to Disneyland's Star Tour's ride, except it takes you to Stark Expo where Hydra starts causing mayhem and Tony Stark saves the day! Definitely a totally different ride from anywhere else and totally worth the wait! I'd also suggest staying here if you have the chance! The hotel's Disney Dim Sum is too cute to miss out!",Disneyland_HongKong
606587111,3,2018-7,South Africa,Quite expensive for not so much to see and do. Rides overcrouded with waiting times of an hour or more. If your first time it might be okey but not for a second visit.,Disneyland_HongKong

Who doesn't love the idea of water   dance   party under the sun? LOL. I believe this is a special for summer only. Hope to go again before it ends.Ah btw, they also added Zootopia meet & greet.

606070688,2,2018-7,United States,"So many things were missing from this park. The castle is so small it is embarrassing and I did not find the American experience translated well. Food prices are obscene   $5 for a bottle of water   so bring your own water if nothing else. There are water fountains but the water is burning hot   really   and I was hesitant to drink it. Mystic Point was a great addition to the park as was Hyperspace Mountain. Strange hours   opening at 10 and closing at 9pm. Also, the train stopped at 6pm which was super disappointing! Why?? Really overall it seemed like a money grab and while the day was enjoyable, as someone in our party (who is a HUGE Disney fan) commented, the place  Is missing the magic . And I agree. Not a bad amusement park   the rides were fun   but the prices... .OUCH! Easy to get to though and the train there is fantastic.

The different shows are a must see so check the schedules. The parade at night is so amazing and beautiful. The down side when we visited was that the castle was under construction so didn't have that show and get to see the castle or all the princess but what a wonderful day. I would recommend using the MTR and Disney Train for an additional experience instead of the bus..You have to do more than 1 day in order to see all the areas or experience the rides, its a long long day and the parks are expensive so make sure you budget for it but its definitely a must to do and see!

Tried the train which stoped us after 2 minutes and told us they were closing for technical reasons which was annoying as we had to go back to the entrance to pick up the child cart we left to enter the ride. Not many rides for our son , in fact not many rides in the park we were expecting slightly more. The prices for food obviously high, water included.

The most famous structure, well, Disney one that it, is the Castle. Once you could walk thru, into or around but not on my day. The lower 40% or so was covered up.

600565694,4,2018-7,New Zealand,This is a smaller disneyland which doesn't have all the draw cards of the larger resorts like tokyo or USA. The cost is expensive for what's here priced at $124 new zealand. Due to the heat it would be better to visit from 2pm until closing as this would give you time to enjoy the park and see the parades. Do take your own food and drink as food here is expensive. The waiting time for most rides can be up to an hour but you might get lucky. Get a fast past to avoid the lines. Take the orange train line to get there and change for the Disney line at sunny bay as shown on the map.,Disneyland_HongKong

599421720,5,2018-7,Philippines,"It's so nice HK has specific station that would take you to Disneyland. So hassle free and easy. We arrived there at 11AM. Tip: buy tickets in advance at klook or kkday as it will save your time queueing. Be there weekdays as tourists flock during weekends. We were so happy the weather was so good! Initially we checked the weather one week before and it states that thunderstorms will occur but it turned out sunny! We were able to enjoy almost all the rides, almost but not all. There are still some live shows but I am not really a fan of it. For me, one day is enough as HK's disney is smaller compared to HK Shanghai and Paris, accordingly. If you're visiting during summer, bring gear up comfortable outfits as it is really hot, and wear rubber shoes as it really involves a lot of walking. ",Disneyland_HongKong
599256920,5,2018-6,United Kingdom,"When we visited the castle was under construction but it certainly didn't take away the Disney magic. It was an amazing sight seeing the park contrasted against the green mountains. There are loads of rides and shows to fill 1 2 days. However there aren't very many shops in main street USA. Still enough to get your Disney goods.Toy story land was roughly the same size as Paris. Their 'big thunder mountain' ride was a high lite. One of the best rides I have ever been on in Disney park. We all came off in fits of laughter and were so unprepared for all the twists and surprises.We could see there were more marvel rides being built so the park is expanding.There aren't as many restaurants as the other parks however there is a fair amount of variety. The food isnt massively catered towards western culture however you can still get burgers, fried chicken ect.Being a huge Disney fan I absolutely loved the park and would love to go back once the new castle has been built.",Disneyland_HongKong

598809669,5,2018-7,Canada,"A very lovely, a very, very, hot Disney visit! Had a great day here. Firstly, it is so easy to get to from either Hing Kong Centre or Kowloon, taking the MTR. Got here upon opening and were able to get in a number of rides with minimal wait times. The park has many familiarities of the US sites, similar    lands    so it   s very easy to navigate, although The Hing Kong park seems smaller and more walkable. Rides my kid loved: Space Mountain (a different name), the Toy Story Hot Wheels ride was awesome, and of course we rode the Grizzly Mine Cars about three times. Food: prices approximate to other parks. If it is warm out, bring as much water as you can. If you only want Western food there are some spots to get this. Overall, I would go again. I was thrilled by wait times, but maybe this was just luck. There were a number of characters we didn   t recognize because they are popular with Disney Japan, but this had no impact on us. The castle was very small and undergoing renovations so it   s too bad we missed that. Parade was great. Check for weather, bring water, enjoy! ",Disneyland_HongKong

Also, kids loved the mystic manor, hyperspace mountain, iron man experience, parachute drop and a couple of shows. Others were mostly routine stuff.Easy to navigate (though a bit hot   in June)Staff were very friendly , everything was well organised. The place is well maintained. Lot of greenery.As expected, food is costly (outside food is not allowed, bags are checked at the entrance).Wifi (free) is not very good, didn't find their app very useful.The night parade was fantastic and worth the wait.We took a two day pass (is only marginally more expensive than one day ticket)Better to go early (and of course avoid holidays and weekends). Still you might find some school trips which will add to the waiting time.Can be easily accessed by MTR, but we preferred to stay in the nearby Disney hotel (regular free shuttle buses are available)",Disneyland_HongKong

I expected that the queues would be very long to every ride and every photo op with the characters. It was indeed. We enjoyed the parades the most. Anyway, on the second day, when i hit the star wars shop, I lost my wallet. I was so pissed when i was told that there was no CCTV in the shop. I couldn't just believe it. But since I don't want our days ruined, I asked help from the outside and still continued the journey until we got rescued by a friend of friend who lent us money for train fare and food. At 4PM though, I got an email from Disney that said that it could be my wallet that has been recovered so I ran to the lost and found area, left my daughter who was on queue to Cinderella Op to two nice local girls and voila, recovered my wallet which was intact by the way. With the many beautiful things that happened in between, someone unknown lent us money, two girls promised to take photos of my daughter with Cinderella in case I don't come back right away, a lady gave me discount coupons for items I want to buy and so on...I paid back good deeds by paying their items and food. The wallet that was returned was so unexpected! For me, that was magical.So there, Disneyland Hongkong is among the happiest place on Earth and is magical. ",Disneyland_HongKong

When you factor in the lines, I don   t think anyone can go through the whole park in one day. We saw maybe a third of it. We were at Disneyland for about 6 hours.The food here is highly overpriced. The shops were crowded, but nice for AC. The bathrooms were a bit dirty. The toilets are on the ground (which is good for boys).There were a lot of rude tourists (adults and kids) who appear to be in a rush and were pushing a lot.Overall, it was worth visiting once. I may or may not go back when my son is older, more patient, and can protect himself from the tourists who push. FYI: I asked them at the gate....

Entry seems to be a very muddled affair with none of the gates moving fast, however when you are in everything works well.They open the different lands at different times which seems very strange. The Mystic Manor is definitely well worth going into.The park has the magic of the Disney parks and is well worth going to. I really am at a loss why you would need 2 days there, but I guess if you have small children it takes a longer to get from place to place.Plenty of different food options to choose from with a good mix of Asian and Western to choose from (prices are Hong Kong Prices so expensive).The parades get very crowded so well worth picking a good spot in the shade before it starts.",Disneyland_HongKong

The park has a lot of repackaged rides areas from Disneyworld and Anaheim Disneyland, which was fine but nothing new. The best rides that are relatively novel to Hong Kong are Iron Man and Mystic Manor (the best, obviously). My favorite part of the whole park was actually the shows, which were really well done and blended Cantonese and English in a very accessible and interesting way. Definitely try to catch the Jedi Training  it was hilarious and great. The shows were the most identifiably  Hong Kong  part of the park, so they were really memorable for me, as a westerner.

The crowds were well behaved and I was not pushed once all day!!!! Even the parades and the projection show were fun, orderly and well managed by the staff. Shanghai Disneyland could learn a lot from Hong Kong. The park is small and the castle was closed which made it feel smaller but it was so clean and happy that we really enjoyed ourselves.

594832530,5,2018-5,India,"Whether you are a child or an adult, do visit this place. It is amazingly beautiful and has many rides for people from all age groups. In summers do not forget to carry your hand fan as it gets very hot and humid. The toilets are available at every 5 10 minutes walk which are very neat and clean and are air conditioned so one can tae rest in the washroom. Outside every washroom, drinking water tap is available so carry your refillable water bottles. Do carry pram if you have a child. Prams are available for rent also. Do not miss the 7pm Mickey magic book show and the 8.30pm parade. The rides almost last not more than a minute. So cant enjoy rides much but the shows are all amazing.",Disneyland_HongKong
594776826,5,2018-6,Australia,"The youngest of our group was 7 and the oldest 57. Everyone had a great time. No extreme rides for thrill seekers, but fun just the same. We went in June so it was hot and humid. Pack water bottles, there are water filling stations everywhere. Go early and be there at opening as it gets really busy around midday. By mid afternoon the park was pumping with people. We went on a weekday so crowds were manageable. My tip would be to do Ironman and that section then hop over to Toyland if that   s on your list as it gets very very hot and crowded over there in the afternoon and there is limited shade. Wait times there were the longest at 30mins and in the heat we decided to bypass it. Food wasn   t as expensive as I expected. It   s not cheap though either, so have a good breakfast and if you choose something like a rice and curry for lunch it will fill you and keep you going until closing. Small snacks could have been taken in, but I think anything big would be confiscated. Don   t miss the Lion King show. I did and family who had seen the stage show and we   re unsure about going to it, said it was fantastic. I now regret not making the time to see it.",Disneyland_HongKong

My sister and I went with our young kids and we just had to be sure to keep ourselves hydrated and get into AC every so often to cool off. We went on a Friday and there was a crowd but we still managed to cover much of the park. I have been to Magic Kingdom Disney in Orlando and it took us 2 days. We felt satisfied with the HK Disney after one day because we had covered so much due to the lack of lines. The Lion King show was a highlight. The Moana show is a new feature but needs more seating as it was very crowded. Overall we had a great time and would recommend!",Disneyland_HongKong

We were finally able to do that while my sister was in town. I will start off by saying, I grew up on Disney World, so it will be really hard to top that. Still, they did a great job with the Disney here. We thoroughly enjoyed it. While it wasn't close to Disney World, it was close to being there. They did a nice job with Tomorrowland. The show we saw was incredibly inclusive. It performed the songs in English. The dialogue was in Cantonese with subtitles on either side in English and Mandarin. Prices were Disney prices. Everything was pretty expensive, but that is the way Disney is. The parade at the end of the night was a lot of fun. Exiting the park was incredibly easy with the MTR stop right there. The kids especially loved the special MTR for the Disney Land. It is worth seeing, but if you've done Disney before, I would maybe suggest checking out Ocean Park. It is unique to Hong Kong and has pandas!!",Disneyland_HongKong

My boys had an awesome time. one day does not seem enough especially if you have kids (toilet breaks nap break icecream break exploring break).

591857578,3,2017-7,India,"The trip to HK Disneyland was a blend of good and bad experiences. Firstly it's a bit expensive travel to and fro in MTR form Hong Kong or Central station to Disneyland. The entry ticket pass is also expensive. The only recommendation I would give is if you have been to any other disneyland's in the world or especially paris, skip this one for sure. There's no need to waste your time, money and a whole day for this place. I have been to another 3 disney's including paris and I am telling you from my experience. It is seriously not worth it. If you have kids who are under 15 then you can surely opt a day out in disney but if you are traveling adults or teens like me in early 20's then it's a strict no. They don't have any thrilling rides for adults or teens. Though the whole idea behind creating a disney park is for children but they should keep in mind that children are not the only age group that visit. Besides it is so packed and flocked. The queues and waiting times are very long and lengthy. There's not much seating space with shade. The food and drinks in the disney are way too expensive. Not much choices for vegetarians. The Ocean Park is a very good alternative for Disneyland. You can choose Ocean Park over Disneyland on any given day and you surely won't regret it. Kids will surely love disneyland but not all age groups I am afraid. The evening lights in the park are very pretty. Hence we made a mistake and sacrificed a day which we could had utilized for a better purpose.",Disneyland_HongKong

It was just not quite    on pointe    and lacked some of that    Disney Magic   . Small things were out of place... for example some of the lights not working and the rain chains not lying correctly in the rain forest scene in    it   s a small world   , a maintenance man fixing a gate that was not even being used (with all his tools on the ground in front of him) in the line of    Ironman Experience    while visitors were walking by to ride and the majority of the non performing cast members looking like they hated their jobs   no smiles.We were looking forward to seeing the new Moana show but the venue is absolutely ridiculous. Only three rows of seats in an area that could accommodate a lot more and not much shade cover so unless you got the seats, you had to stand in the hot sun for 20 minutes to watch. That made the entire show very unenjoyable and was a real downer. The kids hated it and said it was the worst part of their day. It   s seriously just seemed like Disney took the cheap route to create a new entertainment item.Also, we did not see it posted anywhere, not even on the Disneyland app, that they now close the rides in the back of the park one hour before closing time    We wasted time walking to the back of the park to ride some of those rides again and we would have changed our evening schedule had we known they would close early. We used to love riding the Mine Cars in the dark before the park closed.My sister was visiting us and is an avid Disney fan. She said,    No wonder no one comes to this Disneyland. The park is not open enough hours to get your money   s worth, they close some of the rides early and there is not a lot of shade cover compared to the other hot location, Walt Disney World in Florida.   I expect more from Disney. Thankfully, the new Light Parade is fantastic and so the day ended with that classic    Disney Magic   . ",Disneyland_HongKong

Hong Kong disneyland is smaller in comparison to the other Disneyland but it is just as magical, with shows happening all around the park all day long and characters walking the streets. We had a suprise while attending shows when us Americans (being only english speakers) were greeted with bilingual shows! We found this quite entertaining. We went to this park in November so everything was decorated in a Christmas theme and they even had a Christmas parade and a wonderful (fake) Snowfall!!! My friends had been missing our snowy winter weather at home so this was a fantastic surprise when loads of snow was shot over the crowd with flashing Christmas lights and festive music.Would definitely recommend visiting the Hong Kong Disneyland to people of all ages as it is truly the happiest place on earth!

However, water at   3 a bottle was fairly steep.There was some renovation taking place at the laughably small castle which hampered some of the space in the park.Staff were all friendly and courteous throughout. An area for improvement would be the types of badge they give you in entry needing variety (other Disney parks have    just married   ,    Birthday    etc).Having been to an animation academy before at a different Disney, we were pleased that this was available here too. While the classes say they are only in Cantonese, don   t be put off as it   s easy to follow, great fun, and they do throw in a few English explanations along the way.Very easy to get there via HK metro   there   s a special Disney line which takes you the last part of the way.

Choosed Hkg as this was the nearest in terms of flight time from KL, was worried he wouldnt take to kindly to being strapped down to his seat, going was stressful but coming home was easier as he slept throughout his flight. One thing i discovered was in order to take loads of pix with Mickey and gang, best place is to dine in one of theyre restaurants where makes they make scheduled appearances, taking photos with Disney characters in Disneyland itself entails a long queue. Staying in Disney hotels was also a treat. Travelling to and from Disneyland and even to the city was easy as they had frequent free coaches. Going a week before the holidays, and on a weekday, queues for the rides were fast and short. Be prepared to spend though as the Disney Resort Hotel, all day tickets, foods and gift shop items are not cheap. All in all it was an enjoyable experience and my kid had a blast hugging and kissing Mickey and gang, not to mention mummy and daddy had a jolly good time to.

589374511,3,2018-6,Malaysia,It was extremely hot weather in June so avoid summer time.The place is small so it is manageable for family with young children.Go straight to Fantasyland if your kids are below 6 so you can go for most rides.The night parade was worth to watch but a bit disappointed that we didn't get to see any Disney characters walking about for photo taking.Castle is also closed so no fireworks at night.,Disneyland_HongKong
589365081,5,2017-7,Indonesia,"Maybe this attraction prefer to kids. So many kids attraction at here. So after we see disneyland, we promise if we have children this place must be visited again. Easy acces from kowloon. Just get mtr to this place near from airport. Prefer go to this is weekdays. Big place and great experience. One day i think is not enough for around here. There is no masjid (mosque) so little bit difficult for moslem to pray. Every area have greatest show. We only get micky mouse show and very very great. We are very excited and so professional. Foodcourt have halal food. Buy ticket by online is better than on spot. Closing ceremonial is the best show. Thank you",Disneyland_HongKong
589248429,4,2018-6,India,"Check the weather before you go, if it   s raining, you won   t see many characters outside. The outdoor ride close, just indoor options available. A really pleasant surprise was on the 2nd day, the staff at the MTR told me the park may be closed due to the rains, while I bought the tickets. If you still decide to go, we did on both rainy days as we had a 2 day pass, take a rain coat  umbrella. Or pay HK $70 to buy one at the park.Lot of walking to do, plan your visit and what you want to do before you get there. This way you will finish off all that you want, before exhausting yourself and most importantly if you have kids. It can get really hot and humid!My little girl is a princess maniac and the experience of meeting Snow White, Elsa, Sophia, Tinker Bell, Moana was quite phenomenal. I loved the way the characters interact with kids making it a truly memorable experience. If you are looking for A particular character, make sure you check if they are on schedule the day you   re going. E.g. Elsa, we went on Tue and Fri and we could meet Elsa only on Fri. They have fixed timings, so planning will certainly help.The shows are good too, Lion King, Moana, etc. Plan 30 mins per show, minimum. The night parade is awesome, I see kids fascinated by the light show and characters.Food is good, lot of options available. If you have the 2 day pass, make sure you have the eTicket handy the 2nd day, even if you   ve registered with you finger print.Pretty easy to get there via MTR.We   ve been to the one in Paris, this one though smaller definitely packs a punch. With kids or not, you can complete in one day provided you get there early. Happy Mickeying!! :)",Disneyland_HongKong
589220822,5,2018-6,United Kingdom,"I had purchased my park tickets from a travel agent a few days prior, this meant less queuing at the park, it was also cheaper than buying direct, I got this in Tai Po but am sure most travel agents will be able to help.Arrived early Via a 2 buses from Sha Tin, the transport links are brilliant and well signed, We arrived before the park opened so near the front of the que and saw Mickey and Minnie greeting people before the gates officially opened. The park its self is smaller than the others I had visited (Paris and Orlando) but still plenty to do. Lion King Show was a highlight and we saw this twice. With the help of some good fortune Fast passes and single rider queues we managed to get on 11 rides see 2 shows one twice and meet 3 characters so if you plan your day well it   s easy to see a lot of the park in one day, which is not really possible is any of the others. The Space mountain now a Star Wars ride was really well themed, the Avengers part of the park was also very well done with the iron man ride a nice little attraction, but very similar to the Star Wars rides in other parks. The Mickey Mouse celebration projector show was first class and well worth the wait. Couple of Negatives for me, the Castle was closed which we knew about but obviously takes away the famous photo opportunity, also the iPhone app and the Website showed different times for the park closing which also meant it showed the wrong time for the parade, this left me sat on main street an hour longer than I had hopped.But overall a very enjoyable park with some very fun rides, it is most certainly is the happiest place on earth.",Disneyland_HongKong
589094833,4,2018-6,United States,"So, it   s not to the caliber of the original but it is a nice park. Smaller than Anaheim Disney but with a smaller and quite reasonable price tag. Second day ticket is a fraction of the cost of day one. Lines were 20 30 minutes on a Saturday unheard of at other Disney locations.Like the other Disney parks the castle and several other areas are being brought into the 21st century so expect some closures. If your a Disney fan make the stop. In just a few hour layover we were able to ride two rides, explore Main Street, grab lunch and see more than half of the parade.",Disneyland_HongKong
589056529,3,2018-5,Brunei,It was a bit disappointing as the Cinderella castle was under renovation and we didnt get to see the fireworks. The park was smaller than we had imagine it to be. Rides weren't that many either. Good thing was that we went there during the non peak season so we do not really need to queue long for most of the rides. ,Disneyland_HongKong
589034438,4,2017-11,United Kingdom,"Similar to the parks in Tokyo, it's miles ahead of Disneyland Paris (which is atrocious). We got to meet Cinderella, Duffy, Iron Man, Tigger, Winnie The Pooh, StellaLou, Pluto, Goofy, Snow White and saw Ariel. The food and snacks available are tasty and we ate at The Explorer's Club Restaurant where you can choose from a variety of Asian menus. The Iron Man Experience, a ride like Star Tours, is also open now.",Disneyland_HongKong
588842598,5,2018-5,India,"It is a must do for all tourists visiting Hong Kong. While it is quite big and the walk can be tiring,I still recommend people of all ages to visit Disney as it is fun to just let go off your self and become a kid all over again at Disney. There are fast rides as well as moderate rides. For those who do not want to sit on rides can enjoy the shows. Do not miss out on the Lion King Show, Mystic Manor Show, Mickey's Wondrous Book & Phillar's 3 D show. Also a must do is the Night Parade.",Disneyland_HongKong
588802310,4,2018-6,Singapore,Pros:My second visit here. There are new attraction especially the iron man ride. There are also some upgrades and renovations on some of the rides compared to the last round I came which is ten over years ago. Food prices are more reasonable with varieties though taste not very fantastic. Queues are quite long probably due to their public holidays and school holidays and quite a lot of their locals are in the park too. Just a note that there are no more fireworks and parade of the characters. Only lightning visuals displays. Toilets there are cleaner than before and it   s air conditioned. Most of the rides are indoors which is good as the summer period can be very hot like in Singapore. Cons:Not many complaints except for the long queuing time. Worth to visit again if there are new rides in future.,Disneyland_HongKong
588779840,4,2018-5,Singapore,"It   s my 2nd time there in 3 years. This time round we found that some of the ride didn   t seem as good as before as they may have made some alterations. Example that it   s a small world ride used to keep repeating the song the last time but this time it   s just played once combined with the music. The other Pooh ride used to have a lot of pretty panels each time you turn into an area but now it seems the amount of panels has lessen and the ride shorten. Even the night parade cars are less gorgeous as the 1st time we saw it. But then we also discovered other rides we haven   t been able to ride on the first time we went. The new iron man experience was quite awesome! There   s also an iron man virtual reality game for my 2 yr old son at the store in the Tomorrowland which is quite fun while his parents went solo and used the fast passes for the main attractions. As for the other ride we tried as single rider while our son slept, it   s the toy soldier parachute drop. It   s not for young kids.. but teens shld be able to withstand the excitement and not break into tears. Also we think the mickey   s philharmagic at fantasyland is pretty awesome but then my son was a bit scare of it maybe due to the loud noise inside.. so really have to consider if bringing very young kids there. The only one ride that my son loves is the slinky dog spin at toy story land. As for the other ride that his parents enjoyed, it   s the mystic manor. As usual it   s not for very young kids as it   s quite dark in there and can be scary for them. My son is pretty cool with the dumbo ride and obitron which is pretty much the same type of ride. As for food, we think the best food court is at fantasyland and also mystic point. It   s good to go during weekdays as it   s less crowded and if there in summer, do 1 2 of the outdoor rides u wish to try before going indoors for the rest till later in the afternoon. This works really well for us as we try the dumbo and obitron ride first before going indoors for other rides like Pooh ride, mickey   s philarmagic, it   s a small world, Ironman and hyperspace mountain, till later in the day when it   s not so hot did we go to toy story area for the other rides there. Utilize the fast passes and single rider options when you   re there to save some time in the park.",Disneyland_HongKong

588642315,5,2018-4,Bahrain,Its a full day trip at the disneyland. This one isnt bigger like the US one but good enough to keep kids occupied for a day. Beautiful parade at the noon and closing time. And loads of free shows whose timings are posted and updated based on weather conditions. Tip : Can be very crowded for weekend and public holidays with 45 60 min waiting at each ride. Try going on tuesday wed and thurs. Less crowded. Also try cloudy and raininy days.,Disneyland_HongKong

It is very clean with staff regularly cleaning the park. There are several smoking areas around the park and staff are very friendly and will show you where things are. There was almost no long waits for rides which was awesome. The merchandise is reasonably priced, and easy to find in the shops. The light show at the end of the day is breathtaking and beautiful. All around amazing experience! Will definitely return and recommend to anyone! ",Disneyland_HongKong
588019881,5,2018-6,Malaysia,"Visited on a Sunday and it was a long weekend in HK. The great thing is although the crowd could feel overwhelming especially when queuing up at the entrance, somehow when we were inside it didn   t feel as bad. Don   t get me wrong there are queues and everywhere packed but probably because of the design everybody   s dispersed more or less evenly. The food and drinks are expensive but you would expect it given such location so no point complaining. The souvenir shops are well stocked with variety and plenty of shops to temp you and kids. Takes a very strong will to not spend on any item in there. All in a great place to visit, if you have kids just bring them you are guaranteed a good time here. ",Disneyland_HongKong

587107992,5,2018-5,Australia,"My daughter and I had a magical two days here celebrating her 13th birthday, travelling all the way from Sydney, Australia!Right from the time we entered the park on 30th May things were lovely. We loved the photographer who took our photos at the gate and later again on Main St. Her name was Harley and she made our buying the photo pass well worth it! The photo lady at the Winnie the Pooh ride was also really helpful, explaining how the photo pass worked and getting all of our photos downloaded onto the app on my phone. (She also helped me download the app and helped me sign up.) It felt so great to see the professional photos from that day and even breakfast all there, safe on my phone! I wish I could mention her name too!Although we were just able to do all of the rides in one day (we went mid week out of school holidays) we also needed a day to line up and have photos with characters. My daughter loved meeting Piglet, Winnie the Pooh, Eeyore, Cinderella, Aurora, Chip and Dale and Minnie and Mickey. Just be aware that the lines always seem to be really long for Minnie and Mickey and you have to be early and quick for the princesses (except Princess Sophia as she doesn't seem very popular at all).We had 12 fast passes for two each from our hotel (Disney Explorers Lodge) but we only ended up using 5 of them because there was not more than 5 minutes wait time for any ride apart from Winnie the Pooh and the Parachute Drop. We did use them for the Winnie ride because my daughter really loved it. We really loved being near the It's a small world ride early in the day when no one was around. I love that It's a small world and Winnie the Pooh are air conditioned. We also especially loved the Mystic Manor ride (also air conditioned).We took our own water bottles in and loved our meal at the Plaza Inn for my daughter's birthday. (We booked in advance but it was not busy.) The pork fillet was delicious. The other evening we ate fish bites and chips in the cafeteria at Tomorrowland which was pretty standard American food but at least it was air conditioned and quick. We also had the incredibly cute donuts which my daughter loved eating.We knew the castle was being renovated in advance but the Main Street photographers still managed to get nice photos of us with it. Main St was pretty much deserted about 3pm the Wednesday we were there so we got some great photos! Again, thanks to the lovely photographer, Harley!Well worth visiting, especially if you are from Australia as it is not as far as the USA. Thanks, Hong Kong Disneyland, for a magical visit!",Disneyland_HongKong

Disneyland is constantly adding and renewing their attraction. However one main reasons to postpone your visit here (at least until late 2019) because the main castle is under renovation. The renovation also means that there are no fireworks show, which makes come to Disneyland is less worth these days. ",Disneyland_HongKong

586921995,5,2018-4,United Arab Emirates,"Mention Disney, and most immediately think crazy crowds along with Disney Magic. Hong Kong Disneyland is one of my favorite parks because it strikes the perfect balance retaining the magic and charm that we have come to expect from a Disney Park while also having lower than normal (for Disney) crowds! Be sure to avoid weekends and holidays (I only went during non Holiday weekdays) when I hear that crowds can be much thicker, and you will enjoy shorter wait times, the ability to randomly catch a parade or show, and the opportunity to take it all in at a leisurely pace. This Disney fanatic recommends two days to be able to experience EVERYTHING in the park (all the rides, shows, parades and a couple of repeat rides on your favorites) but I realize that I am the exception and that most could do the park well enough in a single day. The unique to Hong Kong Disney rides are definitely worth going out of your way to experience if you are in the area and a fan of Disney at all. For our family, it was simply magical!",Disneyland_HongKong

I am registered blind and do not use any rides, however you can only have a disabled ticket and price of 100 hk dollars if you are a resident otherwise it's full priceSo it makes it very expensive day for me just to get pushed round. Luckily it wasn't too busy as this Disney doesn't do the fast pass entry for those with disabled guests either like Shanghai one does. I had to queue in the line with my daughter and son in law or they had to leave me in the wheelchair before entering line, which can be is uncomfortable when you have very little vision Most staff seem friendly, Overall good but could do better for people with disabilities ",Disneyland_HongKong

Even with the lines (mostly 15 20min wait) we saw almost everything. We missed a few thing because the timing plus we had a child with us, so that don   t help with timing.

The not to miss is all the rides and specially the little world show of dolls. Fun unlimited for kids as they get to click pictures with all the characters of disney here and there...You will need 2days atleast to cover with kids... you start and end with the U.S street there are some places to eat Its best to download their app and be on time for all shows... know how long the lines are in which ride or show... definitely an enjoyable experience ,Disneyland_HongKong

It   s a personal preference.3.finish all the rides on your list before taking pictures. Picture taking will consume most of your time and before you   ll know it, people are already flocking.4.it opens 10AM 8:30PM no fireworks after or you may ask some staffs if they do have that day.5. Its wifi almost everywhere. Bring extra batteries for your phone or cameras. Selfie sticks are not allowed.6. Have a heavy breakfast! Foods are expensive! Or take your lunch early or late.

585983137,5,2018-5,Malaysia,"The most exciting part of our HK trip. To start off, we travelled to Disneyland in MTR to experience the mickey themed train! It was fab.. We loved it.. Even the MTR Disneyland station was so cool! Do not miss this.. If you have enough time.. Take the train! We stayed in Disney's Hollywood Hotel.. It was convenient.. no need to worry about transport.. Plenty of shuttle buses available from the park to the hotels. Coming to the theme park, alot of people suggested that one day is enough to cover the park, but i personally feel that if you want to get a full Disney experience then go for 2 days. That's exactly what we did and we still didn't feel it was enough..(maybe we were just too excited !)The park is big (although i read it was the smallest of disney theme parks). Be sure to get a map and the show schedule when you enter.. Take note of the shows you want to watch and manage your time accordingly. Expect long queues after afternoon at every ride (waiting time around 30 40mins). Tips : (1) Start off with the 'land' that is furthest away first to avoid queues. Some lands open after 11am..The best for us was Toy Story Land.(2) Meals are quite reasonably priced in the park as compared to in the hotels.. So we had lunch and dinner at the park (also because we waited till the final parade). Plenty of Vegetarian options available too. (3) If you have two days, watch all the shows, stage plays and parades on day 1 and do the rides on day 2. That's what we did..so we had ample time for pictures and exploring.(4) If you want to meet and greet characters, be in queue atleast 15mins before else be prepared to wait atleast 60mins in queue. (5) The castle is closed for maintenance works till later this year. There is no fireworks as well. Overall , we had so so much fun in Disney.. Loved it , recommend it !",Disneyland_HongKong

But obviously that was no fault to Disney, it was just bad luck. However thankfully they opened up later in the day so we really enjoyed them. We only ate in one restaurant and the food was really nice and the service was quick and friendly. The shops on main street were also really good. Full of great Disney merch at decent prices. The staff there are also very helpful. Despite there being bigger rides here they definitely aren   t    thrill    rides, but they are still enjoyable, just more on the tame side. Unfortunately they are renovating the castle so we couldn   t get a decent picture infront of it but never mind. The park is also very small compared to other Disneyland   s but we only had a day ticket and we managed to do everything so that was fantastic and worth the money. If you   re wanting a trip to a nice, easy Disneyland that isn   t too expensive then this is definitely the one for you.",Disneyland_HongKong
585696593,4,2018-6,New Zealand,"I had average expectations before going as it is the smallest of all the Disney parks and I have been to Anaheim before. However what greeted me was Disney at its finest. The smaller park size was somewhat an advantage as we got like we ride all the rides more than once and see the shows (which do not disappoint). The castle is a bit of a let down, however it is currently under construction so will shortly be on par. The toy story area was definitely a must see. ",Disneyland_HongKong
585693103,5,2018-5,India,Was always fascinated by disney land growing up & hearing peoples experiences. Finally got to spend 2 days & experience first hand the magical place. great time at hong kong disney land. Will cherish the memories for a long time to come !!!!!!,Disneyland_HongKong
585629946,4,2017-11,Australia,"We first experienced 'Disneyland' in Anaheim California in 1984 with our young children, so our visit to Hong Kong Disneyland was as 'retirees' .. and 'just for fun'. It is much smaller but very easy to get around and we were some of the first to arrive in the morning, and last to leave after a 'Halloween' parade at night. We enjoyed every experience from rides to interactive shows and look forward to the day when we can return with some of our grandchildren.",Disneyland_HongKong
585571449,5,2018-6,Netherlands,Go here with you   re children And have more then a Nice Day. Children And adults all love this park!!,Disneyland_HongKong
585533488,5,2017-8,United Kingdom,"Loved this Disney park, ok not as big as others but no long queues for rides and attractions. We were on most rides without queuing and could walk around and get back on the ride.We have been to paris and Florida Disney numerous times but this just had a different feeling to it, a lot more relaxed and pleasant. We were lucky as it was a overcast day, still hot but kept out the sun.We could watch the parades x2 and fireworks without all the usual hustle and bustle of other Disney Parks.Definitely worth a visit if your in Hong Kong.",Disneyland_HongKong
585488713,4,2018-6,India,"Visited on a Sunday, unfortunately, and it was one of those hot, bright days (3rd June) which meant we couldnt cover too much. Wasted too much time and exhausted ourselves at the start itself waiting for the customary Mickey Minnie photo. Skip it if the line is too long and esp if you are staying at one of the Disney hotels where you can anyway meet them at breakfast. Plan the itinerary well because its no fun going from one land to another in confusion. Its much too hot, food is overpriced, and they don't accept anything but cash for most small purchases like icecream. Although they say outside food and drink not allowed, no one really objected to ours although they checked our bags. Some of the rides like Dumbo and It's a small world are really worth waiting for, but the lines for the Winnie the pooh boat ride were so long and the ride just quite repetitive. I guess you have to prioritize based on your interests. Can't cover it all! By the time we made it to the Lion King show, we were near collapse, I was afraid my son had caught a heat stroke, and we beat a hasty retreat. Happiest place on earth? No way, not in this weather. Not at all. Be careful when you visit in May June with small kids.",Disneyland_HongKong
585462175,5,2018-5,India,"Its fanstastic. Specially for people who come for a holiday with kids, you must visit Disneyland and stay in the Park area itself. You can cover all the rides and shows if you stay for 2 days. Besides the rides, you must try and see all the shows currently going on. The Lion King show was fabulous. Dont miss the parades in the afternoon as well as night parade as both are different. Unfortunately during our visit the castle was closed and there were no fireworks. Try to cover Tomorrowland and Adventure land 1st as there is maximumn waiting time there.",Disneyland_HongKong
585449357,5,2018-1,India,"You need to be smart to enjoy the HK Disneyland. Tips: Its easy to reach by the metro line as there is special metro line for Disneyland. Try to reach before the rope drop. Dont carry selfie stick as its not allowed. Pick the park map. After the rope drop just rush to the attractions of your choice and take the fast pass. Fast pass machines are installed on the important attractions and you can find it in the park map. You can avoid long queues if you pick the fast pass in advance and it gives you the time by when you need to come back for that specific ride attraction. This was you can save time and avoid queues. Please note that you can pick only one fast pass at a time. So plan your day smartly. Do try out the Hyperspace mountain extreme roller coaster and the Mine Cars. Trust me, its not just for kids, adults can enjoy too.",Disneyland_HongKong
585256621,4,2018-5,India,"Nice park with mostly all the characters. Enjoy 4D rides as well Iron Man is not to miss : ), Different characters come out with getup to take pics, make sure you stand in queue on time as they do not allow many people at a single time to click with them. This place is very big and require at least 2 days. Fun for children's and not to be miss by adults too ...Cheers",Disneyland_HongKong
585242549,5,2018-6,Indonesia,"Parents should bring kids  their children here to play. when characters become alive.   Meet Goofy, Mickey Mouse, Bambi, Moana, Toys Story, Ironman  It was entertaining and the place was good to visit. far from city, and most importantly less polution",Disneyland_HongKong
585191083,2,2018-6,Australia,We are from the Gold Coast so spoilt with amazing theme parks but had to tick off Disneyland while in Hong Kong. The place is very well done but hardly any rides and a very small park. The rides they did have we're more geared up for toddlers which is Disneys target market.If you have teenagers I wouldn't suggest it. My kids were very disappointed.,Disneyland_HongKong
585005694,4,2018-5,Philippines,"i couldn   t ask for more except perhaps we should have done it on a colder month and spent a whole day inside the happiest place on earth.we got there at lunchtime and left before sunset to catch our flight home. my husband got nauseous on his first roller coaster ride while our son and i enjoyed the rest of the rides, especially ironman, parachute ride and the horseshoe coaster ride.this theme park is a perfect venue for a family getaway. you   ll enjoy every second you   re there.",Disneyland_HongKong
584978042,5,2018-5,China,"This is such a worthtrying destination once you visit Hongkong, for its beauty, magnificence, marvelousness, majestics. Animation Academy is a good beginning. Main street is full of stylist shop and background for shooting. TIPS is you should follow the path that is contradict to other visitors. Like if people go first with TomorrowLand, you should start with AdventureLand instead so that you don't have to queue and wait for long time. ***Must   try:. Star wars in Tomorrow Land. It's a small world in Fantasy Land. RC Racer in Toy Story Land. Mine Car in Gruzzly Gulch. Rafts in Adventure LandThose are what i have tried and really recommended to others. It's such a sophisticating world that if you can enjoy it, really worth it. ",Disneyland_HongKong
584961708,5,2018-5,India,"Visited Disneyland for 2 days during May 2018 with family.....senior citizen and children as well.This is the place to visit and i love it the most. You can't take your eyes off the d  cor they have made in the Disneyland.Different themes for each area...I believe there are around 5 different themes in the park and each one has unique theme and was surprised to see that even the toilets are made according the themes.Excellent rides, expensive food, don't forget to ride in the Disney train.Do take water with you. They do have drinking water inside but if you have empty bottles it will be good.",Disneyland_HongKong
584858299,5,2018-4,United States,Can be done in a day but start early to catch the shows and meeting the characters. Western food was difficult to find so we snacked on the best popcorn ever. My 4 year old son enjoyed it thoroughly. Glad we took his stroller with. The castle is unfortunately under construction at the moment.,Disneyland_HongKong
584732231,3,2018-6,Australia,"I have been to Disneyland in LA, and thought all Disneyland's were identical. They are not, as obviously there can could be geographical constraints or economic restraints. If you haven't been to any of the Disneyland's around the world and you are in HK, then come. If you have been to Disneyland in LA you will be disappointed ",Disneyland_HongKong
584695782,4,2018-3,India,"We took the two day pass and it was necessary with the kids. Yes, waiting times are crazy, its not as big as Paris Disney and the food is so so, but that's not why you're here, is it? Kids had a great time and the parades were lovely. ",Disneyland_HongKong
584531192,5,2018-4,United Kingdom,"Had a wonderful day, so easy to get here from anywhere in Hong Kong, unlike Disney's in the US it's much quieter, space mountain was never more than a 5 minute queue all day!! Longest we queued for any ride all day was 20 minutes but it was more like 10. FYI Grizzly Gulch had the cheapest food options that I saw, the only alcohol is on Mainstreet and there's smoking areas between each park.It gets really chaotic in mainstreet before the parade but that's to be expected.",Disneyland_HongKong
584446025,4,2018-5,United States,"I was only able to visit HK Disneyland for a few hours due to time constraints but i felt that the park was small enough that i was able to explore most of it within my limited time there. I was able to go on three rides   Iron Man Experience, Hyperspace Mountain, and Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars. I did not wait more than 20 minutes for any of the rides. Though most of the park is designed to look like the original Disney World, the Iron Man ride had a Hong Kong theme. Lunch at the Explorer's Club Restaurant (in Mystic Point) was pricey but good. This park does not compare to the original Disney World, however, it is interesting to visit an international Disney park. The cost of admission is around 600 HKD ($80 USD). I would recommend this park if you are a Disney lover and have a free day while visiting HK. It is easily accessible by MTR.",Disneyland_HongKong
584262583,5,2017-9,Singapore,"We took my 5yo daughter here and she loved every minute. The rides, the shows, the characters. Even the queues weren't too bad. We'll be coming back.",Disneyland_HongKong

584009267,3,2018-5,Australia,"Smaller version of Disneyland California,enjoyed the similarities with a chinese taste,,loved the atmosphere ,the cast members go above and beyond with their every effort to ensure not jus your safety but also ensure an enjoyable time. Larger walking area ,with a train that has three stops, both spoken in English ,Chinese and mandarin. English speaking cast members certainly assisted us in our venture,we spent three days there ,really only one complaint was the amount of open umbrellas that some visitors had use of, they were open even in shops, and in the shade ,spent a lot of time trying to avoid losing an eye or two.",Disneyland_HongKong
