This dataset is an export of \"The Big List\" (of reviews), converted to a CSV format.\n","\n","### Content\n","Each record in the dataset is a single ramen product review. Review numbers are contiguous: more recently reviewed ramen varieties have higher numbers. Brand, Variety (the product name), Country, and Style (Cup? Bowl? Tray?) are pretty self-explanatory. Stars indicate the ramen quality, as assessed by the reviewer, on a 5-point scale; this is the most important column in the dataset!\n","\n","Note that this dataset does not include the text of the reviews themselves. For that, you should browse through https://www.theramenrater.com/ instead!\n","\n","Acknowledgements\n","This dataset is republished as-is from the original BIG LIST on https://www.theramenrater.com/.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"2t3VOWtAzmit"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Import the necessary packages"],"metadata":{"id":"WCbZ263wz7Lf"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"LPOpsxlXzjtI"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Upload and read the `ramen-ratings.csv` dataset"],"metadata":{"id":"D3Yf4gOkz_BR"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"JxonEbbyz-yi"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"Rz8omYPy1g1i"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Explore the dataset and print out basic statistics\n","\n","1.
